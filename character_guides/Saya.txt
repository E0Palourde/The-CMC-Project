Saya overview time! She's a totally harmless very normal and regular girl... She moves pretty slowly, but is surprisingly heavy for the absolutely average girl she is, and she's got some nice range and tricks she can employ, Saya doesn't really excel in any one area and can do whatever she wants, though she generally likes to be close
Jab is a quick short range hit that can combo to grab and her tilts at most %s, pretty nice (5%)
F-tilt has fairly long reach with her completely normal hair tendril that all females have, very nice for keeping foes away or poking (8%)
U-tilt is incredible, it's quite short ranged but hits all around Saya and is very quick, it also repeatedly combos into itself and aerials until high %s, scary (6%)
D-tilt is comparable to a jab with higher knockback and slightly more range, it can combo into stuff as well, mainly F-tilt or F-Sp, pretty good (4%)
Dash attack is a bit slow but has great range and moves Saya forward, can combo to F-Sp at low-mid %s, less great at high %s though (10%)
F-Smash is a little slow overall but it's fantastic for killing with good range too, the main move to try when you want your foe to not be alive anymore (15% < 25%)
U-Smash has slightly worse range and damage than F-Smash, but it's decent at killing vertically,  better for use on platforms (13% < 23%)
D-Smash is fast, lasts for a while, deals good damage, hits both sides to catch rollers, but greatly struggles with killing, fantastic move anyways (10% < 20% front, 8% < 18% back) 
N-Sp sends out a happy little blob to go forth and hug foes, falling down if it's in the air, decent to harass at long range and to get time to move in easier, poor knockback though (8%)
F-Sp very quickly raises up with a tendril slap before spiking with a 2nd hit, good range damage and knockback, but it has a cooldown of a couple seconds to prevent spamming, obviously best off-stage (4%, 8% = 12%)
U-Sp stalls a bit and launches Saya up really far, but it has no hitbox and doesn't auto grab the ledge, making it extremely risky, try to use it as a last resort
D-Sp summons a friendly lumberjack to chop whatever it perceives as wood, it's stationary but can fall if spawned in the air, deals nice damage and knockback to foes that wander too close, lasts for about 5 seconds (12%)
N-air hits 3 times, each hit has good reach and some knockback, it's hard to combo them all together, can maybe combo to stuff on the ground at low %s (7%x3 = 21%)
F-air has shorter range than N-air but it can spike, pretty good at it too, also can combo to stuff if it hits a grounded foe at low %s, great move (8%)
B-air is a bit slow but decently powerful, not great at killing other than off-stage (10%) 
U-air moves Saya up a little bit, can be useful for recovering, also has good range and is nice for juggling foes, has a weaker hit close to her that launches horizontally (9% tendril, 7% close)
D-air has Saya charge diagonally downwards and spike on the last hit, can combo to stuff like F-Sp or D-tilt if it lands on the ground before that, an excellent move (2%x4, 6% last hit = 14%)
Grab is fairly has long range, it's nice, pummel (2%) is average speed, U-throw (10%) can combo to aerials, grab again, and F-Sp at low-mid %s, very nice .. F-throw (12%) has poor knockback and is mostly for damage/positioning .. B-throw (11%)  is similar to F-throw but has slightly more knockback .. D-throw (8%) buries foes and can combo into lots of stuff after, hooray
In summery: If you want to play as a plain regular female person that can do most things pretty effectively, Saya is definitely the one for you ðŸ‘Œ
