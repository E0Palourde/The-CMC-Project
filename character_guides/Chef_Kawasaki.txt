Chef Kawasaki overview time! Chef is a very slow fighter, especially in the air, but he boasts incredible range on some attacks to make up for it, he can fight at any range well enough, but excels at mid range
Jab stabs his foe with a fork, tap again then hold to start rapidly stabbing, can combo into his U-smash after, an incredible move (<1%)
F-tilt is rather slow, doesn't hit much further than jab, and doesn't have great knockback either, I suggest avoiding this one mostly (8%)
U-tilt suffers from the same issues as F-tilt, but with even shorter range than jab and it sometimes hurts Chef for 1%, don't use it (9%)
D-tilt is also a tad slow, but it's got decent range, damage, and knockback, though the hitbox stays where the food was initially sitting, and doesn't follow it as it hops away, use it occasionally (11%)
Dash attack is good for suddenly charging at your opponent, but it's unsafe since Chef just stops moving after a little bit, so it's not good for much unless you're sure it's going to hit, has weaker knockback at the end (6%)
F-smash is typical, powerful and slow but short range, use it if you have a big opening for it (17% < 24%)
U-smash is incredible, starts up fast and hits thrice, first in front of Chef and ending behind, can combo out of jab for huge damage, but also can whiff if hitting at the edge of the first hit.. (4%, 8%, 12% = 24!%   <   12, 14, 18 = 44!!%)
D-smash bounces along the ground 3 times, awkward to use and only hits grounded foes with weak knockback compared to the others, but at least the damage is good if you can land all the hits I guess? (4, 4, 12 = 20% < 8, 8, 17 = 31%)
N-Sp pauses a bit/stalls in the air then throws out three very quick plate projectiles, only the last one has good knockback, very good move, can be used to snipe opponents (4% each)
F-Sp pauses a bit/stalls in the air then throws out three to five random items in random arcs that deal seemingly random damage between 1-3% each? If you get lucky, they could allow you to combo into other moves, such as plates or a grab, really nice to have despite the RNG potentially messing you up (?%) 
U-Sp blasts upwards and has a fairly strong hit at the beginning of the move, and a decent hitbox, snaps to the ledge too, overall a pretty nice recovery..If Chef's horizontal speed wasn't so terrible.. (14% early, 7% late)
D-Sp summons a cooking pot right next to Chef (even in the air), when pressing down B you can spawn a food item that seemingly randomly heals between 1 and 5%, using U-Sp, pummel, U-throw, F-Sp, N-Sp, and even opponent's projectiles too, will also spawn plenty of food while destroying the projectile, but Chef doesn't have the movement to take advantage of all this food, it's best used as a shield against projectiles, or to make food then bait your opponent to come closer.. For some reason has a random chance to create a pot that does not make any food? (Yes the food still spawns even when all items are disabled)
N-air is okay, quick, has decent knockback and damage, but a small hitbox and your air mobility is terrible (9%)
F-air is great, really strong, has a spiking hitbox on its first active frame, can easily kill without it too (14% early, 11% late)
B-air is pretty good, basically a faster weaker version of F-air that can still kill nicely, I like it, has a small weaker hit inside of Chef (9%, 7% weak)
U-air is insanely good, has huuuge range and hits all along the weapon, has a spiking sweetspot at the top in its last frames, but you'll almost never hit that.. Not that you need it, it kills off the top easily enough (9%, 12% sweetspot)
D-air is not that good, kills you off stage, but can spike, though you just have better less risky options (7%)
Grab is absolutely incredible, has massive horizontal range, pummel is unreal, deals 4% really quickly.. D-throw is pretty useless, only deals 6% and can't combo, F-throw can at least send them off-stage, despite doing even less at 3%, B-throw deals a respectable 13% and can kill at the ledge, pretty nice .. But U-throw is the undisputed best by a long shot, it can combo into things at low %s, especially U-air, it can  kill at later %s too, and it deals 22%! Wow!
In summery, Chef is a very weird man, half his moves aren't that great, the other half are amazing.. If you're looking for something wacky to sink your teeth into, give him a try
