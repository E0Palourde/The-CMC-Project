Taiga overview time! She's a speedy swordfighter with high damage and a poor vertical recovery, she excels at edgeguarding and pressuring foes
Jab has good range to catch rollers since it hits in front and behind, and hits twice, sending your foe behind you, pretty nice (3%, 3% = 6%)
F-tilt also has good reach and knocks back a decent amount, though it does have some recovery it's still useful (9%)
U-tilt is quite fast and can combo to itself and aerials like N-air and U-air, very good, use it often (7%)
D-tilt spikes for some reason, has a weaker hit near the end that doesn't send as far, could probably be used to combo into grab at low %s (10% early, 7% late)
Dash attack is rather weak even if you hit early, it's also a tad slow to recover, there are better moves you can do most of the time (9% early, 7% late)
F-smash is a strong punish tool that can spike, not much else to say about it (15% < 22%)
U-smash is fast and has great horizontal range, but can't really kill well at all.. (10% < 18%)
D-smash is also fast, and hits all around Taiga, very good but hard to combo at full charge (3%x3, 10% = 19% < 10%x3, 18% = 48%!)
N-Sp is quick with good range, it can cancel to itself to keep attacking forever, dealing extremely high damage if the opponent can't DI well enough, nice move (1% per strike, min 9%)
F-Sp is a short ranged headbutt that kills shields on hit, making it very dangerous, but it has some recovery if it misses and doesn't do much on an actual hit (2%)
U-Sp goes decently horizontally, but not vertically, at least it doesn't send you into freefall I guess (2%x3, 7% = 13%)
D-Sp is a bit slow to start, but has good range and stuns for a moment allowing for a follow-up, pretty great except against shields (12%)
N-air lasts for a long while and has really good horizontal range, can combo into stuff like grab if you hit a grounded foe at low-mid %s, nice (8%)
F-air is kinda fast, really strong, and your main killing move, it even has good knockback at low %s, use it often! (7%)
B-air can spike at the bottom, but is slow and weak otherwise, use it if you want to I guess (10% spike, 5% other)
U-air is fast and rather strong, but has a lot of recovery after, it's decent enough for juggling foes and killing vertically if you're high up (7%)
D-air can combo into itself at low-mid %s, but isn't really worth much otherwise even if it can cancel it's recovery to other aerials (8%)
Grab is quick and decently long ranged, pretty good, pummel (2%) is average speed, B-throw (10%) is mostly for positioning as it can't kill or combo .. D-throw (6%) also can't kill or combo, and is pretty useless since you recover later than the opponent if they tech .. F-throw is strong and can kill at high %s, nice .. U-throw (5%) is just for positioning at high %s, bad at low-mid%s..
In summery: If you just want a nice and simple swordfighter without much combos and just wanna hurt things, give Taiga a shot
