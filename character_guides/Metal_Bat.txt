Metal Bat overview! MB is a very interesting glass cannon type fighter, with poor jumps and air mobility, but good running speed, he also has a unique mechanic in his Bat Meter™️ , which increases in increments once he reaches 25%, 50, 75, 100, and maxes at 150% damage, the more the Bat Meter™️ is filled, the more knockback all of his moves will do, to help with this, his taunt deals 5% damage to himself, allowing you to reach higher increments easier if you're just a little off, he excels at hit & run tactics and punishing opponent's mistakes
His jab can combo into itself at low %s, it also has decent range, hits behind him, and is quick, good move (3%)
F-tilt is quick and can knock opponents pretty far away at high bat meter, can also combo after jab, pretty good (6%)
U-tilt hits 3 times and is pretty short ranged, can combo to U-Sp occasionally, otherwise isn't all that special (2%x3 = 6%)
D-tilt is a half-hearted kick, slow bad range and bad damage, nearly useless.. (2%)
Dash attack has good range and passable knockback, and since you're kinda fast, it makes it a great move to punish opponents (5%)
(All of MB's smash attacks have less recovery if they manage to hit the opponent) 
F-smash is strong and has the same range as dash attack, but with a hefty amount of recovery, use it as a punish or for edgeguarding (5% < 12%)
U-smash has a nice tall hitbox, but that's about all it has going for it, it's damage is pitiful and it likely won't kill as early as F-smash can (2% < 5%)
D-smash deals the most damage out of the three, and does comparable knockback to F-smash, but the range isn't as good, still nice to have (8% < 15%)
D-Sp is a very long lasting counter, MB might still take damage from the attack, and the counter hit itself is weak, but in addition to that it also gives you a special buff that greatly enhances N-Sp, F-Sp, D-air, and makes all your smash attacks, d-tilt, and b-throw do more damage and knockback, you can stack this buff seemingly as many times as you want, but all it will do is add 2% extra damage to your next enhanced move, the buff does persist after death too, all stacks will go away if you land a single enhanced move
N-Sp makes MB spin like a top, slowly moving and falling through the air, will stop once he hits the opponent 22 times, doesn't seem to be very good.. (8% - 10% if hit with inital spin)
F-Sp dashes forwards, stunning foes that are nearby when the move starts, a great movement/recovery/punish tool that can be done multiple times in the air, use it often (4%) while enhanced, the dash goes much much farther, but uses up your buff reguardless of if it hits or not
U-Sp leaps up and forward while swinging the bat, simple and effective, but it won't be killing anytime soon, and you'll have to learn how to B-reverse it to optimally recover (3%, enhanced 8%) while enhanced and close to your opponent, will teleport above their head and slam the bat down, making it a terrifyingly effective punish tool! When not close however, will do a little jump upwards, which for some reason can chain into itself forever, allowing infinite flight..That's just not right...
N-air is kinda difficult to hit fully, and only really leads to jab or u-tilt if you manage to do it against a grounded foe, at least it's good for conserving momentum in the air (2%x4 = 8%)
F-air is rather slow and has trouble killing unless off-stage, but d-air is better for that anyways, not too good (8%)
B-air is just really strong and fast, great move aside from the long recovery (10%)
D-air is a tad slow, but it spikes, so it's still pretty good.. When enhanced, becomes much faster! (6%)
Grab has decent range and is really quick, pummel is a little fast but only deals 1%, U-throw (3%) is best when you have no bat meter since the opponent might just land into another grab or a jab .. D-throw (15%) deals great damage .. F-throw (6%) is really strong at the ledge once you have bat meter .. And B-throw is unique in that it sends almost nowhere and depends on how close to the ledge you're at, allowing you to combo into some other stuff if your positioning is right
In summery, if you like waiting for the right moment to counter your opponent's attack, or just wanna smack your foe with a bat, try MB and go for a home run
