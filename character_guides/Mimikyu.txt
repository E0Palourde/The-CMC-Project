Mimikyu overview time! This spooky Pikachu knockoff is a speedy little mid-to-close range fighter with a fairly simple yet effective toolset, though they can struggle to kill, they excel at combos, and pressuring foes
Jab is a quick short ranged smack that can combo into itself, f-tilt, and grab, this is great if you're ever close enough to land it (3%)
F-tilt is really fast and has good range, deals decent damage too, good move (0.5%x6, 5% final hit = 8%)
U-tilt is a tad slow and can't really combo to stuff, but has fair range and nice knockback at high %s, it's decent (8%)
D-tilt is a bit slower than F-tilt, but has slightly more range and combos into it, as well as grab, at high %s it can combo to aerials, a super effective move! (9%)
Dash attack can cancel to any other move if it hits, the sweetspot at the start does good damage and at low %s combos to grab or aerials, the weaker late hit is usually best to combo with U-tilt, or at higher %s it combos to aerials too, a neat move for sure (14% early, 7% late)
F-smash is slow and can't kill all that well for the serious risk it puts you in, at least the range is decent and it's active for a while, though it has an even weaker late hit..
(15% < 22% early, 12% < 20% late)
U-smash isn't as slow, and can kill earlier especially on a platform, but it has worse range and active time, still nice (16% < 24%)
D-smash spikes if you hit at the tip, which isn't great on-stage, and sends horizontally if you hit from up real close, having comparable knockback to F-smash in that case, it's pretty good then (16% < 24%)
N-Sp deals good shield damage and has fine range, but it has some recovery, takes a while to charge up to max, and it even hurts yourself, not worth it in most cases
(10% < 35% .. 3% < 15% self damage) 
F-Sp is amazing, launches a series of straight high priority projectiles that can be ran ahead after to combo into/out of anything, can also combo from a weak dash attack at lower %s, it's only downside is that it has a cooldown of about 3 seconds, helpfully indicated by the afterimages Mim makes during that time (2%x4 = 8%)
U-Sp stalls before launching Mim in any direction you choose, dealing damage along the way and putting it in freefall after, a pretty good recovery (max 10 hits, 13%)
D-Sp makes 2 shields instantly appear on either side of Mim, dealing minor damage and set knockback, the shields flash on and off and will reflect projectiles but only while on, allowing very fast projectiles to slip through sometimes, still a very nice move to have, also lets Mim gently float down while in the air (5%)
N-air is great, quick all-around move that combos into itself and likely other aerials in the air, and all your tilts if you land on the ground before the last hit, use it often (1%x6, 2% = 8%)
F-air is fast and deals good damage, but very little knockback, can combo to grab at most %s on grounded foes, really good (10%)
B-air has less damage but more knockback than F-air, can only combo to grab at low %s, and can't kill well anyways, not too great (8%)
U-air is basically U-tilt in the air, pretty strong with good range, nice move (8%)
D-air is great since it has nice range, damage, and it spikes, allowing for a kill if you're lucky (12%)
Grab is quick with long range, very nice, pummel (2%) is also pretty quick, F-throw (5%) and B-throw (10%) can't really kill, so are just for positioning ... U-throw (5%) can kill at really high %s, especially on a platform, it can combo into stuff too but is outshined by .. D-throw (10%) is amazing, it has very low knockback even at high %s, and can usually combo to any aerial or U-tilt, use it all the time
