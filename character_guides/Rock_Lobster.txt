Rock Lobster overview time!? It's a purple lobster monster thing?? It's horrendously slow and struggles with range most of the time, but is very powerful if it can get close, it enjoys being in the air due to it's aerials having decent range and also it has a whopping 5 total jumps and decent recovery too, it excels at dealing damage and hitting hard
Jab is very strong but slow and short ranged, can knock the opponent either direction based on which side of the explosion hits, use it carefully (16%)
F-tilt has a psychic hitbox with good range and okay knockback, fairly nice (8%)
U-tilt is nearly worthless, slow, bad range, and low damage (2%)
D-tilt hits with it's magical stretching foot, has a fine hitbox but poor knockback, it's okay (11%)
Dash attack would be a decent movement option if it didn't stall for a while at the end, only use it if it'll hit  (6%)
F-smash is extremely powerful but a little slow with not great range, nice for a big punish (3%, 17% = 20% < 10%, 24% = 34%)
U-smash is like F-smash but aiming up and with even shorter range, it's okay (4%, 16% = 20% < 12%, 22% = 34%)
D-smash hits forward and knocks the opponent into the 2nd hit, it's alright but can't kill as well as F-smash (2%, 17% = 19% < 10%, 24% = 34%)
N-Sp breathes fire as long as you hold it, dealing extremely high damage and causing knockback near it's mouth, best to use at the ledge probably, or anywhere, (3-4%? per flame)
F-Sp launches it at high speeds super far, going straight ahead even in the air, sending it into freefall after, this is a very risky move best for recovering or gaining distance if you're certain you won't fall off the edge with it (17%)
U-Sp creates up to 3 explosions to launch it up when you press the button, each one getting more powerful, the 3rd is able to kill at very early %s, once you start the move all you can do is explode (8%, 11%, 14%)
D-Sp has short range and is very slow to recover, creates 2 hitboxes, one right in front of Lobster and the other lingers wherever it was when it started the move until the move ends, not very good despite the high damage, it has poor knockback (22% Lobster, 7% linger = 29%)
N-air spins around for a while and deals good damage, but it has slow startup, can actually combo to tilts if you land on the ground at low %s (9%)
F-air is slow to start but has good range and damage, decent knockback too, a fine move (11%)
B-air is similar to F-air but has more damage, range, and knockback, an actually incredible move (17%)
U-air deals more damage right at the beginning and lingers for a long time after, really good despite the low range (19% start, 12% late)
D-air has great reach and is a quite powerful spike, but of course it's still rather slow, still nice though (7%)
Grabs ..  Lobster has no grabs, what would it need grabs for? It can create explosions and breathe fire! It just does a taunt instead of grabbing
In summery: Lobster is a joke, a very powerful joke
