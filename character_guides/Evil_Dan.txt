Evil Dan (Dan Hibiki alt) overview time! The normally terrible Dan's hidden power is unleashed, becoming an actually decent fighter! He's got some mostly simple combos and powerful up-close attacks, along with a couple fine projectiles, making him a well rounded fighter suitable for players of all skill levels, he excels at combos and whatever else he wants to do
All of Dan's normals can cancel into all his specials on hit
Jab is Dan's best move, it has 3 hits and all can cancel to all his tilts as well as specials, allowing it to combo to D-tilt, which combos to jab, looping and dealing crazy damage unless the opponent knows how to DI, and you should only use the first 2 hits, the 3rd one knocks back too far to combo to anything, however the first 2 hits are awful against shields and you should go for the 3rd one then (3%, 2%, 4% = 9%)
F-tilt is a quick chop with passable range and knockback, it's decent but can't combo easily (8%)
U-tilt has the same bad horizontal range as jab, but is like D-tilt in that it combos into jab and aerials at higher %s, it's alright to use sometimes (8%)
D-tilt has good range, loops with jab, combos to aerials at higher %s, and almost always combos to specials as well, a fantastic move (8%)
Dash attack is okay, kinda slow and can combo to jab at low %s, otherwise it mostly combos to aerials and specials (8%)
F-Smash is pretty powerful and has 2 hits, first hit can combo to specials, overall pretty nice (7%, 7% = 14% < 14%, 15% = 29%)
U-Smash has great vertical reach, is strong, and fast, very nice (15% < 22%)
D-Smash is like F-Smash but hits once and has some more recovery and a little less knockback, also can't combo to specials, not too great.. (14% < 22%)
N-Sp fires a slow fireball straight ahead that goes some distance before disappearing, it's decent at mid range harassment (5%)
F-Sp launches forward with 3 kicks, your main combo finisher, can combo to jab/d-tilt at low %s, and kills at high %s, also helps with recovering, fantastic (3%, 3%, 4% = 10%)
U-Sp goes up some but puts Dan into freefall after, is strongest right at the beginning and can kill fairly well then, pretty good (11% early, 8% late)
D-Sp hastily scribbles an autograph for his fan before throwing it out to them, causing the fan to be stunned in awe for a moment, letting Dan take advantage with a free combo, doesn't work vs shields, can change the angle of where you throw it by holding a direction (8%)
N-air does good damage and can combo to grounded moves like D-tilt, as well as aerial specials, it's a wonderful kick (10%)
F-air has 2 hits, the 2nd one struggles to combo to specials, while the 1st has very low knockback and can combo to pretty much anything if you hit it on the ground, decent but N-air is usually better (5%, 6% = 11%)
B-air has decent range and good knockback at high %s, that's it really (8%)
U-air does good damage, can combo to stuff on the ground, and combos to U-Sp until high %s, pretty good (10%)
D-air is just a slow powerful spiking hit, nice to use (10%)
Grab is really quick with short range and some recovery, pummel (2%) is kinda fast, D-throw (7%) just kinda tosses them on the ground, not that good .. F-throw (8%) is mostly for positioning and can't really kill until very high %s .. B-throw (9%) can kill much earlier and is quite dangerous at the ledge .. U-throw (10%) can kill vertically
In summery: If you want to go from being a joke character to an actually playable fighter with lots of combos, you have to become evil, let the hate flow through you..
