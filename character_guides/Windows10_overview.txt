Windows 10 overview time! They're a small but average weight operating system with a unique style of attack, they can fight well at all ranges, especially up close, and Microsoft Excel at combos and whatever else they want to do, Win10 is suitable for players of all skill levels
Jab is 3 hits, at the edge of the 1st the 2nd can whiff, but it still combos to the 3rd so it's not a huge issue, fast and decent range (2%, 2%, 4% = 8%)
F-tilt has 4 hits and pops the opponent into the air, can combo to aerials  easily at low-mid %s, also good vs shields, great move (2%x3, 5% = 11%)
U-tilt very fast, combos to itself and aerials too, another very nice move (5%)
D-tilt is similarly fast, slides forward a bit, and has 2 hits, can combo to aerials, not great when U-tilt exists but at least it can hit the ground (3%, 2% = 5%)
Dash attack is once again super fast, short ranged, and actually quite strong at high %s, pretty good overall (2%x4, 4% = 12%)
F-Smash has slightly more range than jab 1, and is far stronger than dash attack, but it actually has some startup and recovery, best as a punish (14% < 22%)
U-Smash is faster than F-Smash, and has a nice hitbox above Win10, but doesn't quite have as much knockback (14% < 22%)
D-Smash hits on both sides and is the weakest of the smashes, but it has the fastest recovery, so it's decent for catching rollers and the like (13% < 20%)
N-Sp uses Clippy to throw random slightly bouncy letters at the opponent for minor damage and knockback, an annoyance at best when you have nothing better to do at range (3%)
F-Sp summons the cursor, causing Win10 to float gently down if they're in the air at the moment, cursor can be controlled while Win10 is left totally vulnerable, press a button to click a foe and grab them, you can then toss them in 1 of 4 directions, best against recovering foes as the cursor is hard to accurately aim (12%)
U-Sp cloud saves  while Win10 hops up, press U-Sp again at any time to reload back to where the cloud save was stored with another hop that sends you into freefall, this is amazing and allows you to recover from anywhere so long as you remember to save your progress
D-Sp nearly instantly zaps nearby foes, can be held to do it up to 5 times in a row (6 if you hit at least once), if you have a cloud save active it skips the 1st zap to delete it instead, exploding foes close to it (5% zap, 12% delete)
N-air is amazing and combos into itself and most other moves, almost no startup and a generous hitbox, use it all the time! (1%x4, 3% = 7%)
F-air is quite powerful with a large hitbox, but has a weak late hit, best used at high %s as a combo finisher (8% early, 6% late)
B-air is a weaker F-air with a smaller hitbox, only advantage it has is that it's slightly faster, it's okay I guess (7%)
U-air is quick and has 2 hits, it can be unreliable to string together, but it can combo to other aerials afterwards sometimes, decent for juggling foes (2%, 6% = 8%)
D-air also has 2 hits, the 1st can be used to start combos if it hits a grounded foe, and the 2nd can spike if it hits at the start, the move lasts for a while after though with a weak hit that knocks away, overall it's a very nice move (4%, 7% = 11%.. 4% late 2nd hit)
Grab has decent range and very good speed, pummel (2%) is just average speed though .. F-throw (5%) is good for sending foes off-stage at high %s and not much else .. B-throw (9%) has worse knockback than F-throw but more damage .. U-throw (10%) can combo to aerials at low-mid %s, very nice, best throw .. D-throw (4%) can sometimes combo to jab at low %s, and beyond 100% it becomes a deadly spike that can kill off-stage foes!
