Garfield (G) overview time! He's a lazy cat that's got surprisingly effective yet silly-looking attacks and is fairly good at racking up damage if he can get in to make use of the majority of his moves, though if he can't get in he could always just keep tossing lasagna.. He excels at everything related to close range combat
Jab is forced to do all 3 hits even with 1 button press, and the last hit, despite being surprisingly powerful, doesn't true combo on grounded foes at least, this is a serious issue that greatly weakens the use of this move... (2%, 3%, 6% = 11%)
F-tilt has a weak hit inside of G that can combo to grab and some other stuff too probably, the strong hit at the foot deals nice damage and knockback, it's a good move (4% weak, 10% strong)
U-tilt isn't great, it doesn't seem to combo into stuff, and it's hard to land strong hit doesn't have any knockback, but the weaker one does, also the text becomes reversed if facing left (2% arm, 5% no u)
D-tilt is a tad slow to start and lacking in range, but it can combo to grab at low %s, and aerials at mid %s, making it a decent option sometimes (6%)
Dash attack has an early and late hit, early hit has more knockback, but they can both combo easily after, usually grab at low-mid %, and aerials at mid-high %s, only drawback is the range and active time is pretty short (6% early, 7% late)
F-Smash is surprisingly powerful and kinda quick, but it has very short range, so get in there (11% < 18%)
U-Smash is fast, hits all-around G, and isn't half bad at killing either, it's nice aside from the low damage (8% < 10%)
D-Smash has good range and can catch rollers, but is poor at killing, will always knock your foe to the left, so by facing left, the weaker behind hit can pull them in front of you, allowing for a combo, usually into grab (9% < 16% front hit, 4% < 12% back hit)
N-Sp quickly throws the coveted gravity-defying lasagna straight ahead, deals minor damage and decent knockback, really good for long range harassment until you can get in (3%)
F-Sp is basically a second F-Smash with slightly better range but slightly more startup, sends foes at a much more dangerous angle too, deadly off-stage if you want to risk that (12%)
U-Sp isn't great, G keeps his current momentum going for a bit (So don't use this while falling if you want max height) then shoryukens up a decent amount, hitting once and not auto grabbing the ledge... (8%)
D-Sp is a weird quick leap up before a spiking elbow drop, you can combo after it usually with aerials, until high %s, for some reason it only works on the ground and has a 1 second cooldown between uses, it could be useful to avoid a low attack and counter I guess (10%)
N-air is pretty good, fast and can be comboed into from many things, has nice knockback too (8%)
F-air is a bit slow to start but lasts for a little while and can follow-up with other aerials after, but it'll never kill, it's just decent (8%)
B-air is slower than F-air with less damage and about the same knockback, at least it lasts a bit longer, but it's not really worth it.. (6%)
U-air is quick and decently strong, it causes G to move up slightly, allowing you to spam it to fall much slower than normal and aid in recovering, very nice (7%)
D-air lets G fall and spike foes, similar to D-Sp but usable in the air, so it's great, you can make it back if done off-stage fairly easily too (6%)
Grab is average range and speed, pummel (2%) is also completely average .. U-throw (5%) is pretty useless, can't combo nor kill .. D-throw (12%, 10% at high %) normally knocks foes straight down, but if they're hurt enough it'll send them far horizontally for some reason, it's alright .. F-throw (9%) has the best knockback at high %s, pretty good at killing .. 
B-throw (15%) is mostly for damage and to put the opponent into a bad spot, since it'll never ever outright kill them
