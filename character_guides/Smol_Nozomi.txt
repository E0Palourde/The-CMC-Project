Smol Nozomi overview time! She's a speedy little fighter with generally short range, a fairly good recovery, solid damage and killpower, she excels at edgeguarding and pressuring foes
Jab takes 3 button presses and has smol range, it's seemingly inconsistent on whether you'll be close enough to land all hits unless you're pretty much inside your opponent, it's okay I guess (1%, 2%x3, 3% = 11%)
F-tilt has the same range as jab, is a bit slow overall but also rather strong, able to easily knock foes away at higher %s (9%)
U-tilt is fairly quick, chains into itself and probably aerials too, pretty good, but it's awkward hitbox hampers it, not hitting grounded foes too well unless you're super close (8%)
D-tilt is nice, average speed, it combos to grab at low-mid %s, and some aerials after that (7%)
Dash attack is of course short ranged, the stronger early hit has passable knockback but doesn't combo to anything, but the later hit can likely combo to jab/grab, making it the better of the two (10% early, 7% late)
F-Smash is pretty strong and lasts for a bit of time, pretty nice (16% < 24%)
U-Smash is similarly strong and lasts even longer, starting at 26% damage (for the uncharged smash, charged will freeze even earlier), the second hit will freeze foes, requiring them to mash to get out quickly (4%, 14% = 18% < 6%, 20% = 26%)
D-Smash is the strongest and hits on both sides of Nozomi, it can kill quite early and isn't much slower compared to the other smashes, great move (19% < 26%)
N-Sp sings a song for a couple seconds, stunning nearby foes for a moment and ignoring shields, doesn't do anything against airborne opponents though so don't try it off-stage, stun time slightly increases the more hurt the foe is too, it's a high risk high reward move
F-Sp twirls at a high speed and tackles foes, difficult to hit with all of it, and can aid in recovery, but is only helpful once, starting at 78%, the last hit will freeze foes (1%x10, 3% last hit = 13%)
U-Sp helicopters upwards, has no hitbox itself and somewhat odd controls during this, but can at least cancel to other moves, won't automatically grab the ledge if you're still holding up
D-Sp is a shine, you can jump cancel it, and it can reflect projectiles, has a bit of knockback that can be used most effectively on recovering foes (3%)
N-air is difficult/inconsistent to hit with all of it, but has a good hitbox regardless and is quite fast, decent move (2%x5, 5% last hit = 15%)
F-air is also quick and thankfully only has 1 hit to deal with, it's got some knockback and can sometimes chain with itself for nice damage (9%)
B-air is a slower more powerful F-air that can kill at high %s, especially well off-stage, decent (12%)
U-air is quick with strong knockback on each of it's 3 hits at high %s, preventing them from comboing, but at low %s you might get lucky enough to combo multiple of itself in a row for massive damage (10% per hit)
D-air is Nozomi's best move, super fast, good hitbox, nice damage, it can cancel to all other aerials on hit, and is a powerful killing spike itself, use it all the time, for some reason if you try to cancel to D-Sp, it does N-air instead? (9%)
Grab has decent range, pummel (2%) is average speed, B-throw (12%) is just for damage and positioning, as it can't combo or kill .. U-throw (5%) is pretty useless, unless you really want your opponent in the air at high %s for some reason .. F-throw (7%) can kill at high %s .. D-throw (10%) is just a better F-throw, able to kill earlier, quite nice
In summery: If you want to play as a cute little singing lady with the ability to kick your enemies straight down to their deaths whenever you want, pick Nozomi
