Zangief (Z) overview time! He is extremely slow, big, and has a horrifically bad recovery, but if he can get in, he'll crush his opponent in no time with his incredible grabs and deadly close up strikes! It's very important to know that in this game, most character's physical attacks can destroy (some) projectiles, and Zangief is no different there
Z doesn't have a traditional run, he can only walk, running instead does a dash grab that can be canceled during the first half with a jump, if he grabs the opponent you can press attack to bite for damage, or special to suplex for knockback at high %s, don't press anything and they'll fall out, you don't want that (15% bite, 3% suplex)
All of Z's normals aside from F-Smash can be special canceled to everything except N-Sp, trying to cancel to that will just do U-Sp instead
Jab has 2 hits, the 2nd one has decent knockback, can combo to F-AB at low %s and only comes out if you land the 1st, meanwhile the 1st hit can combo to any other special, usually D-Sp is best, or you can instead go for a grab right after the jab as a mix-up (1%, 6% = 7%)
F-tilt is great, really quick, good damage, and good range, your main projectile destroying tool too, it can combo to F-AB at most %s, but also works with D-Sp at low %s, use it often (8%)
U-tilt is slow with poor knockback, can combo to U-Sp but just isn't worth going for most of the time (9%)
D-tilt is also slow and has slightly less range than F-tilt, for less damage, it does have a 2nd hit but it's got poor knockback, making it ill advised to go for over canceling to a special, not great (5%, 7% = 12%)
Dash attack? Due to no traditional running, he doesn't have one 
F-Smash, extremely strong (especially when charged) with great range, but it has a lot of recovery too, best to use as a punish or after a charged D-Sp (8% < 11%)
U-Smash is also very strong and hits twice, good for catching falling/jumping foes, nice (5%, 8% = 13% < 5%, 13% = 18%)
D-Smash is a slow but powerful spiking hit best used at the ledge against a recovering foe, does a lot of damage when charged (11% < 34%)
N-Sp is why they fear you, it's like Z's regular grab but you're forced to Atomic Buster, you also can't use it during a combo, but you can use it right after a combo ends, you can hold a direction once it starts to go in said direction, careful when going off-stage with it though! (40%!!)
F-Sp has some startup and kinda short range but a higher priority for destroying even more projectiles, but it's recovery prevents it from comboing well.. (5%)
F-AB: If you smash the stick forward as you do F-Sp, or simply press forward A+B, you'll get a powered up F-Sp that goes further, whiffing against close opponents but dealing more damage and able to combo into jab, or go for a grab/N-Sp instead! This version is much better and one of Z's best moves, can also be used to recover (7%)
U-Sp goes almost nowhere in the air, making it a total joke of a recovery, but it's better than F-AB if you need the height, on the ground it's fast and can destroy a couple projectiles easily, but the noticeable recovery and lack of movement means f-tilt is still superior in that regard (11%)
D-Sp is amazing, quick stunning kick that has 1 hit of super armor and can be dash canceled out of at any time, also chargeable for more stun time and shield damage, use it often, though you can only stun once per combo and it has a few seconds of cooldown before it can stun again, also only your dash-grab works against stunned foes (8% < 12%)
N-air lasts a while and hits all-around Z, making it decent for destroying projectiles, that's about all it's good for though (7%)
F-air is really strong with good range, but it's slow, making it difficult to do from a single jump (11%)
B-air is also difficult to do, since Z always automatically faces his opponent, it's a slow chop that spikes, it's not great (7%)
U-air is faster than B-air, also spikes, and hits in front, but it has a small hitbox, still really good though (9%)
D-air is great and sends Z down, can follow-up with U-smash, regular grab, dash grab, jump up after with another aerial, or even a mid-air N-Sp for massive damage! Just don't do it off-stage.. (6%)
Grab is very short range but kinda quick at least, pummel (4%) is fast .. D-throw (8%) combos into stuff, such as D-Sp and F-tilt,  also another grab against huge fighters, fantastic! .. B-throw (12%) leaps up and throws down, best near the ledge to kill at high %s .. U-throw (9%) is mostly for aerial follow-ups, but at low %s you could do U-Smash or something, it's not the best throw .. F-throw (9%) is a far stronger version of dash-grab's special suplex, it's your main finishing move and your best regular throw, use it often!
In summery, if you want to play as a big beefy traditional grappler with some combos on the side, pick up Zangief and make Mother Russia proud!
