Shokuhou Misaki overview time! She's got average weight, 5 total jumps, and 2 total moves! She excels at edgeguarding and mind control, and is suitable for every kind of player
Pressing any normal button, including jab, tilts, dash attack, aerials, and smash attacks, all just does a quick star blast all around Misaki, it has set knockback, meaning it will never get stronger nor kill aside from edgeguarding, strictly a get off me tool or for pushing back recovering foes, Dash attack/f-tilt/f-smash are the best versions since you can move forward while doing it (15%)
Any special instead does a slower all-around attack that ignores shields and hijacks half of your opponent's mind, you will gain half control up to 6 seconds, or if Misaki gets knocked back at all, while under half control, both you and your opponent control their character together, while Misaki stands completely still, their goal is to hit Misaki, while you can try to run them off the stage and make them KO themselves, the opponent cannot run normally, while Misaki's inputs always runs instead of walks
Grabs? Don't be silly, special already ignores shields, throwing the opponent is beneath her
In summery: Misaki can use the skills of every fighter in one, making her technically the most difficult character to master, play her so you can brag to your friends about it
