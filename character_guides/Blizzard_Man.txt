Blizzard Man overview!? So, Blizzard Man is big, kinda slow, and clunky, but quite a threat when he has the advantage, he excels at grappling and edgeguarding
His jab sprays snowflakes out that knock opponents away, it's decent, especially when at the ledge, fires a min of 6 flakes, but can hold the button down to keep it up (1% per flake)
D-tilt is just like jab, but sprays slightly more downwards and sends the opponent down and away, this is generally better for edgeguarding, so use this more often, min 5 flakes (1% per)
U-tilt sprays a min of 5 flakes high up, making it a really good anti-air, it seems to stun longer than the other flake moves, and thus can combo into things at low-mid %s, such as aerials, great move (1% per)
Starting at 126%, jab, u-tilt, and d-tilt will freeze the opponent, forcing them to mash out of it or land on the ground to escape
F-tilt is a slow, very short range, but dangerously powerful attack, really nice for finishing off opponents if you can land it (11%)
Dash attack is okay for a bit of extra speed, but the hitbox doesn't last long, and it does minor damage and knockback, you have better ways to move around anyways (5%)
F-smash rolls forward, sliding along the ground after, it's pretty strong and has a good hitbox, can't fall off the ledge with it, good move despite slow startup (19% < 26%)
U-smash curls up and leaps into the air, decent but normally goes only straight up and can be kinda hard to hit with as a result (19% < 26%)
D-smash rolls back and forth, the hitbox lasts a long time and is pretty great for catching landings or rolls or anything really, though it's weaker than the other two (12% < 20%)
All of Blizz's smash attacks can be greatly improved with something I call a "hop-smash", basically you do any air action, including just jumping, and make sure you're fully recovered before touching the ground, hold either left/right and do not let it go or do any additional moves, at any time you're still holding a direction, input a smash attack, and that move will do a hop on initiating it, adding to its range, you can control the direction of the hop after you input said smash attack too..
N-Sp launches 4 flake projectiles, 2 straight ahead, 1 going up, and another down, this down one can possibly appear below the stage and go through it to aid in edgeguarding, overall a decent move, but has a lot of recovery, only use it when you're not in danger (3% straight, 4% up/down)
F-Sp gives Blizz a great amount of speed, can turn around, and cancel it with special again or the shield button, but only deals damage at top speed and loses its hitbox until you turn around, it can't be canceled fast enough to combo into anything, unless you're in the air, in which case jumping will cancel it instantly, can be held down to delay the attack, but doesn't seem to get any stronger or faster from doing so, overall a fine move (8%)
D-Sp slowly forms an ice block that slowly slides along the ground, okay for pressure I guess, and can combo into anything if your opponent lets it (5%)
U-Sp is awful, leaps only straight up super high into the air, with no hitbox nor the ability to cancel it by grabbing the ledge, also puts you into freefall after, but you have to do it to get back on stage most of the time as your double jump sends you hardly anywhere..
N-air is really nice, lasts forever and has almost no startup nor recovery, great for edgeguarding and just generally being an annoyance (9%)
F-air is not so nice, has noticeable startup and recovery, but it can combo into some stuff at low %s, such as F-Sp and U-tilt I guess, bad at higher %s though (5%)
B-air is a great but kinda slow killing move, at 49%+ it'll start freezing opponents, the hitbox lasts for a while too (11%)
U-air is quite powerful, but only has a tiny hitbox after Blizz's arm has been hanging out for a while, making it awkward to land (11%)
D-air hits twice, once below then behind, really powerful, nice move (5%, 12% = 17%)
Grab is quick with decent range, pummel is average speed and deals 2%, throws are all great, all of them can combo into lots of stuff, especially U-throw (10%), 
D-throw is mostly a weaker B-throw but can do some good anyways (11%, freezes at 60+%)
F-throw is great for killing mostly (11%, freezes at 60+%)
And B-throw deals extremely high damage, but the 2nd hit can whiff at higher %s (24!?%, freezes at 47+%)
In summery, if you want a cool and funky grappler that has interesting options alongside that, Blizzard Man is for you
