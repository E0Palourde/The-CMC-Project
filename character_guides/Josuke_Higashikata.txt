Josuke overview time! He's at first glance a simple mid-to-close range fighter, but he has some crazy tricks up his sleeves, he excels at punching things and edgeguarding
Jab is incredible, does 2 short range hits before going into a super powerful flurry of punches with the help of Crazy Diamond, who cannot be hurt, meaning all attacks that utilize CD are disjointed, you can hold the button down during the flurry to make it last as long as you want (2%, 2%, 1% per flurry punch, 5% final hit)
F-tilt is slow and short ranged, while it can kill, you also have F-Smash, which is faster, disjointed, and kills earlier, ignore this move (7%)
U-tilt is quick and can possibly chain into itself and aerials, it's fairly good (8%)
D-tilt doesn't really kill or combo into anything, doesn't have good range either, not worth it usually (6%)
Dash attack is a bit slow and short ranged, but at least it has okay knockback I guess (9%)
F-smash is quick, good range, and decently strong, great move especially near the ledge (13% < 20%)
U-smash is alright for hitting foes above you, but it's got kinda slow startup too, making it a little hard to do so (13% < 20%)
D-smash is about as quick as F-smash, but has worse range, it sends at a much better angle though and is dangerous to be hit by even at low %s (12% < 20%)
N-Sp fires a fist from CD that hits once then again as it returns to you, can even combo off of the returning hit, hold to delay the move, but can't cancel it or anything, you can hold up/down to influence where the fist will go initially, and move around to influence the rebounding hit, a very nice projectile (5%)
F-Sp spawns a motorcycle, you can jump while on it even if you spawned it in mid-air to aid with recovery, and it lasts for a few seconds with a few seconds of cooldown after, hits a max of 5 times and can spike opponents who are underneath as it falls (2%x4, 5% final hit = 13%)
U-Sp levitates a pipe(?) while standing on it, can do any air action during it which will drop the pipe down, it will also drop after waiting enough (10%)
D-Sp has CD slowly punch, will bury grounded foes and spike airborne ones, if done on the ground also summons a rock for 7 seconds, this rock is treated as a wall and cannot be stood on, projectiles will pass through freely though, you can use this in a variety of ways such as forcing the opponent to jump over it, or making it harder to recover, or knocking them into the rock to bounce off for an extended combo (8%)
N-air is a quick punch that can't kill and has trouble comboing into stuff, at least it does okay damage (7%)
F-air and B-air are both strong but slightly slow, they have good disjointed hitboxes thanks to CD (9% each)
U-air can kill off the top sometimes, and is decent for juggling, despite having almost the same hitbox as f-air (8%)
D-air is outstanding, it can carry foes downwards and lead into combos if they land, or it will spike at the end for the kill (1%x8 = 8%)
Grab is a little slow with short range, pummel is average speed and deals 2% .. none of his throws really combo into anything, B-throw (10%) can kill at the ledge .. F-throw (12%) is just a stronger B-throw, amazing .. U-throw (13%) can kill off the top ... And finally D-throw (16%) is mostly for damage
In summery: if you like punching things, riding motorcycles, and making rocks and pipes appear out of thin air, Josuke is definitely for you
