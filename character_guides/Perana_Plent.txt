PERANA PLENT? This fighter excels at P h o t o s y n t h e s i s
Plent jab good (6%)
F-tilt is jab but moves, much better, combos into itself and can carry foes around the stage (6%)
U-tilt chomps, low range, bad damage, decent hitbox (4%)
D-tilt error 404 file not found
Dash attack is jab but moves even faster, best jab confirmed? (6%)
F-smash error 404 smash not found, just turns you around
U-smash this is a really strong chomp, great move for anti-airing, strong plent teeth ... Is what I would say if this move did anything
D-smash, the D stands for dumb, Perana is not dumb, so Perana has no dumb-smash move
N-Sp huuuge startup for a huuuuge fireball, use against recovering foes or something I dunno, you do what you think is best and I'll support your decision (23%)
F-Sp doesn't exist in this timeline
U-Sp, Perana is perfect, and therefore doesn't need a recovery, because that would imply they can be hurt
D-Sp, instantly summons THE POT to smash over enemy heads, has a lot of recovery but does good shield damage, easily combos out of jab variants to kill off-stage (22%)
N-air, quick and can kill, tiny hitbox for tiny leaves (6%)
F-air the latest and greatest in jab technology! Behold the incredible upgraded Jab MK II sporting a whopping 2% increased damage! (8%)
B-air. . . . .
U-air is U-tilt but in the sky, Perana has learned how to bite in flight! Nothing is safe anymore! (4%)
D-air slow and really strong, just like a proper perana, lying in wait for the right moment preferably in a pipe, then it gets you (24%)
Grab: grabs? It's a plant, you think it can hold onto things with leaves? That's just silly!
In summery: remember to water your plants today, they might grow big and strong like this one
