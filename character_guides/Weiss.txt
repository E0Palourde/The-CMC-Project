Weiss overview time! She's got average weight and has a slower falling speed than most, and very few combos, but she makes up for it by having a fairly well ranged sword that she can poke with, along with tricky special attacks, she excels at hit & run, and is suitable for more advanced players
Jab is 3 hits, decent range and knockback which can even kill at high %s, but at point blank the last hit can whiff (2%, 3%, 4% = 9%)
F-tilt is a quick poke with good range and solid damage, very nice (8%)
U-tilt has huge reach and is great for dealing with foes above Weiss, another very nice move (8%)
D-tilt is fairly slow overall, has slightly worse range than F-tilt, also can't really kill or combo into anything, not worth using much.. (7%)
Dash attack is an awkward double kick that struggles to land the 2nd hit sometimes, also can't combo or kill really, not too great (5%, 6% = 11%)
F-Smash is both quick and deals good damage, but it only hits in front of her and isn't the best at killing, still good though (14% < 20%)
U-Smash has great reach around Weiss and lasts for some time, making it great for catching rollers and landings, but it also leaves you vulnerable too, be careful with it, the move will start freezing foes beyond 38%, or 15% for the max charge version  (14% < 22%)
D-Smash is a little slower overall than F-Smash, and has around the same range, but it has an inner hitbox that knocks foes backwards, so it's still decent (14% < 22%)
N-Sp places a light symbol on the ground that acts as a platform for everyone, press N-Sp again to change it to a dark symbol which is not a platform, N-Sp in the air stalls your fall and places similar symbols but the light one is also not a platform this time, these all last for 5 seconds, with the timer resetting once light changes to dark, they are instantly destroyed if the other specials interact with them
F-Sp charges forwards a long ways and does a powerful slash at the end, if the symbols below Weiss touch a dark symbol at any point, you can press special again to
let loose a series of 3 hits, the first two if hitting a shield will bypass it and allow the remaining hits to go through, very nice and good for recovering (7% charge, 15% slash, 4%x3 triple strike)
U-Sp has bad horizontal range, but is quite strong initially, later on the move's knockback is weak though, if Weiss moves across a dark symbol she'll dash up a second time for increased range (14%)
D-Sp on the ground creates an icicle that strikes foes at a set distance away, unless you have a ground light symbol, in which case it will always show up there, allowing for traps, will freeze beyond 124% (5%)
D-Sp in the air places a ground light symbol below Weiss if there isn't one out already, allowing her to recover much easier, it also summons an ice sword that if close enough will home on on the opponent's current location, if there's an air light symbol it'll be summoned from there instead of near Weiss (5%)
N-air has short range and is a tad slow but it's also a very powerful spike, great to use off-stage, of course (4%)
F-air is not active for long at all, making it difficult to hit with despite it's pretty good range, also can't kill or combo easily, not the best.. (7%)
B-air is somewhat similar to dash attack, inheriting the difficulty with landing the 2nd hit, apparently the tip of the heel during the 2nd hit can spike, but it's very difficult to land and N-air is a good enough spike anyways, the move is okay (5%, 6% = 11%)
U-air hits just above Weiss and has almost no knockback, making it not very good for juggling foes, or anything else aside from some damage really.. (10%)
D-air speeds downwards and spikes at the start, but still has fine knockback after, recovers easily and thus can be used to fall faster than normal, a fantastic move, the light symbol is just aesthetic (14% start, 10% late)
Grab has average range and speed, Pummel (2%) is also very average .. F-throw (14%) places an air light symbol if there isn't one out already, can kill at very high %s, good for damage and positioning otherwise .. B-throw (8%) kills much more easily than the other throws, but deals the least damage, nice move .. U-throw (13%) moves both you and the opponent further forward, good damage too, but can't kill too well .. D-throw (10%) knocks foes down and is dangerous for them off-stage, it's decent
In summery: If you want a fancy and technical swordfighter without having to worry about combos, Weiss is likely for you
