Chess King overview time! They're a totally unique fighter that plays like nobody else, having only a handful of moves, but they shouldn't be underestimated, if you can think tactically, even a chess piece can fight well! They excel at strategically slamming themselves into enemies over and over
You start as a noble King, King is awful, having terrible movement and little range on his attacks, along with a large amount of recovery, all King attacks deal 8%
Jab attacks around King while stationary, bad
F-tilt slides forward a bit, still bad but not quite as awful as jab
U-tilt moves up a bit
D-tilt is just like jab but it can spike, so it's a little better against recovering foes
all aerials are the same as the tilts/jab, but in the air, in addition to those, Chess King has access to diagonal aerials: df, uf, ub, and db-air all move in that direction while knocking the opponent that way as well, db/df-air can be used as decent spikes at higher %s, so that's good, King can only do 1 aerial in the air, but the others can do 2
Smash attacks? F-smash turns you around, but that's all..
You cannot grab the ledge with this fighter, but it will snap to it, resetting your double jump, air dodge, and aerial uses, you can only snap to the ledge a max of 5 times before you have to touch the ground again though
U-Sp transforms you back into King and leaps you high up at the cost of sacrificing pieces in this order: Pawn < Knight < Bishop < Rook < Queen, you have 8 pawns, 1 Queen, and 2 each of Knight, Bishop, and Rook, the only way to get more pieces is to be KO'd
Holding any special but U-Sp allows you to transform into 1 of 5 different pieces, you cannot willingly transform back into King, but if you take 10+% damage as another piece (without transforming into another piece which resets how much damage you need to take), you'll heal for 10% and turn back into King, but you will lose that chess piece until you're KO'd, you don't lose pieces from transforming from one to the other, and can do so as many times as you wish
Pawn (neutral while selecting a piece) is hardly better than King, but it's still an improvement, they also do 8% damage and go a bit further with their attacks, they're also short which can help with dodging, F-tilt/B-air/F-air send this piece up and to the left/right instead of straight forwards, if you manage to land 6 hits as a single Pawn, it'll transform into an extra Queen, dealing 10% on the 6th hit
Knight (left/right depending on direction facing) is a step up from Pawn, with quicker movements, much better jumps, and more powerful 10% damage attacks, it doesn't go up/down far with u-tilt/u-air/d-air, but can go sideways on the ground only, using diagonal df-tilts
Bishop (left/right depending on direction facing) also does 10%, but doesn't jump quite as high as Knight, it travels extremely far with it's attacks though, but can only go diagonally unless using df-tilts, it's long ranged attacks downwards are deadly off-stage
Rook (down) is small like a Pawn and jumps pathetically, and can only move in straight directions, but it is very powerful, dealing 12%
Queen (up) has it all, incredible ground speed, jump height, 12% damage, and can move in any direction like King, and has the best range as well, but you only get 1 unless you can land 6 hits as a pawn, you lose it if you take 10% damage with it, be extra careful to try and save it by transforming into something else before that happens, otherwise it might be.. Checkmate
Grab and throws are the exact same across all pieces: grab itself is kinda slow but has decent range, along with a blind spot if you're right on top of your foe,  pummel is average and nothing special (2%) .. F-throw can maybe combo with a Queen/Rook's f-tilt at low %s, but is best at high %s where it will send off-stage easily (8%) .. B-throw is slightly stronger than F-throw but worse at low %s for comboing (8%)
U-throw deals good damage and allows you to easily combo a Queen/Rook's u-tilt, but it can't kill (10%) .. D-throw is very powerful and spikes off-stage foes and is still very powerful when not off-stage, best results at high %s (10%)
In summery: If you want a totally different experience, and to show that you're not only more skilled than your opponent, but smarter too, pick Chess King
