Red Mist overview time! RM is a frighteningly powerful figure, she wields a variety of deadly weapons and fights with brutal blows that deal high damage to foes and their shields alike, though she is a big target, and said attacks are very slow, so you'll have to be careful with her, she excels at hitting really hard from most ranges
Jab is slow and has 2 simultaneous hits, at the tip it can miss the 2nd actually powerful hit, unfortunately, but it's still decent I guess, can spike airborne foes (6%, 10% = 16%)
F-tilt is about the same speed and range as jab, and it can kill horizontally without suffering from the 'you might miss the big hit' problem, very nice (13%)
U-tilt is a little faster and good at hitting foes right above you, but that's about all, it can't kill that well (2%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 6% = 18%)
D-tilt is very fast with great range and some recovery after, deals really high shield damage too, outstanding and your best tilt, despite not killing well (11%)
Dash attack stops in place and winds up a big gloved punch, can kill at high %s but isn't all that great due to halting your momentum (10%)
F-smash is just a slower stronger F-tilt, nice move (20% < 31%)
U-smash starts out really quick, with a good close up hitbox too, but leaves you vulnerable if it's avoided since you're forced to go through the 3 attacks every time (5%, 7%, 12% = 24% < 8%, 11%, 19% = 38%)
D-smash is great at the ledge and not unbearably slow, does especially good vs shields too, very nice (22% < 34%) 
N-Sp slowly winds up then throws a spear at a high speed, it can stun for a little while, but doesn't allow for follow-ups since it takes a while to recover too, not great but your only real option at long range (11%)
F-Sp is relatively quick and fires a tall projectile that completely ignores shields! Though your foe can likely roll through it instead if they're grounded, it's still nice to have (13%)
U-Sp launches in whatever direction you want with her gloved hand, goes a good distance but doesn't automatically grab the ledge, making it quite risky, you can combo the initial punch with the explosion at the end sometimes, takes away your double jump if you havn't used it yet (10% fist, 8% explosion)
D-Sp extraordinarily slow toss then manual control of the scythe with a lightspeed dash after to where the scythe was, deals extreme damage at the start and end of the dash, said start and end points also completely destroy shields, your foe better stop you from starting this move, it's the best to use after a shield break, just run close to them, initiate down special, and hold down to keep the scythe on the floor so it doesn't hit them out of it  (18% scythe, 16% dash through, 40% dash start and end points)
N-air is just jab in the air, but remember it spikes, so it's much better here! (6%, 10% = 16%)
F-air is a slightly slower slightly stronger f-tilt, pretty good at killing especially at the ledge (13%)
B-air sends foes at a slightly downwards angle, best against jumpers and near the ledge, has a super long weird backflip recovery animation (11%)
U-air is similar to U-tilt but weaker and in the air, tricky to land all hits, will make you stall a bit if you do it just after a jump (2%, 3%, 3%, 4% = 12%)
D-air is a stall then fall move, almost certainly gonna kill you if you do it off-stage, powerful falling spike though, slams on the ground upon landing (8% fall, 12% slam)
Grab is short-ish range and long lasting, as a result it can leave you vulnerable for a while if you miss.. Pummel (4%) is great and a bit quick .. F-throw (9%) can kill at the ledge nicely ..     B-throw (7%) is weird and can't kill well, only used for positioning .. U-throw (10%) can kill off the top okay ... D-throw (12%) spikes down and forwards at the ledge and is super dangerous there, otherwise it's not great
In summery: If you just like big strong people with big strong weapons to demolish whatever is in your way, pick Red Mist and instill fear wherever you go
