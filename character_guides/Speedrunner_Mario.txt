Speedrunner Mario (SM) overview time! Not your average Mario, this one can build up movement speed, going from a snails pace to being even faster than Sonic, his top speed is around 4 times faster than his lowest speed, he excels at hit & run tactics and whatever else he fancies at the moment
Speed is measured at the speedometer above SM's % and goes up to 9,999, it constantly decreases when you're not attacking, increases slightly whenever you land an attack, and resets to 0 if you're KO'd.. 
The only other way to gain speed is to use D-Sp, holding it causes SM to backwards long jump (BLJ) repeatedly, moving backwards slightly over time and gaining around 500 speed per second, this means it takes about 20 seconds of this to reach max speed, it also has a hitbox around SM that deals no damage and just pushes foes away, could be good for edgeguarding
but there's a better way, if you gently tap D-Sp you'll release a scuttlebug which erratically moves left and right while raising up, each left/right movement of it will increase the speed you gain from jumping on it by 500, up to 4 times at 2,000, 
After that, it will start glowing, jumping on it then will instead cause a rip in the fabric of reality as SM gains max speed almost instantly from standing in there, while opponents inside are severely hurt but don't take knockback, the opponent can jump on a scuttlebug too to stop it, but it still causes a rip if it was glowing (10?% per second in rip)
Jab takes 3 button presses and has good range, is fast, has low recovery, and good damage, fantastic (4%, 4%, 8% = 16%)
F-tilt has comparable range to jab but much more knockback, can kill at high %s, pretty good to throw out occasionally (6%)
U-tilt covers all around SM, can't really combo too well but it can be effective to use it repeatedly anyways (8% front, 7% above, 5% behind)
D-tilt has good range that can be increased by doing a dash just before, (same as U-tilt) further increased by your current speed to ridiculous across the stage attacks! It also can combo to stuff at low-mid %s, such as jab and grab, nice (7%)
Dash attack is similar to D-tilt in that it's range also increases massively with speed gained, but it can't combo as easily and can't kill, not really worth it, stick with D-tilt.. (6%)
F-Smash is a short ranged quick slap that becomes a mighty double slap on hit once your speed reaches beyond 4,500, fantastic move, use it often (11% < 15% single, 19% < 26% double)
U-Smash  opens up a secret exit that once at 4,500+ speed, tries to pull nearby foes closer, it's a pretty good attack but sadly doesn't have good knockback (max 16 hits, 17% < 28%)
D-Smash has low damage and knockback as a parallel universe (PU) SM attacks with the original, at 4,500+ speed it gains 2 more PU SMs with much more range and knockback, it's fairly good then (4% < 8%)
N-Sp spawns either a bouncing egg, a koopa shell, or a straight flying Bowser based on how long you held the button down, all of these are pretty great especially at edgeguarding, at 4,500+ speed it charges much faster but the items deal half damage, still good though (3% egg, 6% shell, 12% Bowser .. 1.5%, 3%, 6% at 4,500+)
F-Sp spends 1,000 speed to do a BLJ that increases in distance and power the more speed you have, you'll go into freefall upon it ending in the air, including hitting a foe, so be extremely careful with this move, it's alright but too risky to use at high speed unless you're sure where you'll end up (3% 0 < 20% 9,999)
U-Sp leaps up and tosses a bob-omb down, sending SM to freefall after, raises slightly higher every 1,000 speed up to 5,000, a decent recovery and the bob-omb is fairly powerful too, though at 4,500+ speed the bob-omb's power is cut in half for some reason (12% < 6% 4,500+)
D-Sp we already covered in excruciating detail above
N-air has SM hover and glitch out, dealing knockback on the last hit based on where the opponent is in relation to him, surprisingly powerful at high %s, though not great at comboing, you can control SMs aerial momentum while doing it too to help recover, nice (1%, 1%, 2% = 4%)
F-air is a quick slap with good range and decent knockback, can combo to stuff at low %s if it hits on the ground, just great (8%)
B-air has a weak hit at the elbow and a spiking sweetspot at the fist right at the start, the elbow hit can combo into itself easily at higher speeds, while the fist can be useful for finishing off foes, solid move (7% fist early, 6% elbow, 6% fist late)
U-air is okay at juggling I guess but doesn't really do much, especially the late hit at the fist, not too great (5%, 2% late)
D-air is a dangerous falling spike that will kill you if you miss off-stage, occasionally worth the risk if you're sure it'll hit, not too great on-stage either (10%)
Grab has good range and is fairly quick, pummel (2%) is also quick, F-throw (11%) has poor knockback and can't kill, only good for damage and positioning .. U-throw (6%) stuns you longer than the opponent at low %s, at high %s it can combo to N-air I guess but that's it, nearly useless .. B-throw (6%) has good initial knockback but struggles to kill, mostly for positioning .. D-throw (9%) can combo to stuff at low-mid %s and spike off-stage, your best throw, special mention to Taunt which tosses a star behind SM that can spike (5%)
In summery: if you want something totally unique while also feeling a little familiar, maybe you should take up speedrunning, and give Speedrunner Mario a chance
