Mr Incredible overview! He's a very unorthodox close combat fighter, having low damage but high knockback attacks, and extremely useful movement abilities, he excels at edgeguarding and being fast
Jab is nothing special really, has mediocre range and knockback, can go for an attack/grab mix after maybe (3, 3 = 6%)
F-tilt is great, really fast and has good knockback, poor range like jab though, but it doesn't matter much since you can walk forward and do it (5%)
U-tilt is quick and has a tall hitbox, can combo into itself or aerials at lower %s, pretty good (6%)
D-tilt, awesome, can combo into many things after, including F-smash and grab (4%)
Dash attack is just a running D-tilt, still awesome (4%)
F-smash has decent knockback and is really quick, better at high %s though (5% < 12%)
U-smash is a slower stronger U-tilt, it's alright, but you won't be killing off the top much with Incredible (9% < 16%)
D-smash is a slow spiking move that jumps straight up and buries grounded opponents too, allowing you to follow-up with a grab or something after (8% < 8%) .. D-smash can be improved with a technique I call a "hop-smash", if you simply jump into the air, or do any aerial action and fully recover before hitting the ground, then immediately down smash, you can freely control yourself during the move, allowing you to d-smash off of the ledge for example, you can store the hop by holding forward while you're on the ground, but doing anything other than down smash will not allow you to hop after, you can also charge the down smash and still hop too if you want
N-Sp, a giant wind up rushing punch, again good for edgeguarding, and especially if you break a shield.. You stall while in the air and can even float by holding left/right (10%)
D-Sp, a slow leap upwards into a mighty ground pounding punch, only hits on the ground, can be canceled at any point by tapping the shield button, making it useful for recovery, but it will use up your air dodge unless you already used it earlier, overall a decent move for aerial mobility, slow to use as an attack though, will regain it upon being hit in the air (10%)
U-Sp, another leap upwards, but without any attack, simple but effective recovery that leaves Incredible quite vulnerable during it
F-Sp, channel your inner Sonic! The uncharged version is best, because it combos after into almost anything against grounded opopnents, including grabs, f-smash, dash attack/d-tilt, short-hop f-air, etc.. You can cancel its grounded version at any time with shield, even while rolling and in recovery.. If you successfully hit while airborne, Incredible will try a second spiking hit that dives downwards, but it usually misses, which is fine since in case it does miss, this lets you slide along the ground and chase after your reeling opponent for a combo!
There is an advanced technique you can do unique to F-Sp, if you do it in the air, then tap the shield button just as the attack hitbox starts to come out, you'll gain a sudden burst of forward momentum, this momentum gets stronger the more you charge up the roll too, and is influenced by what direction you're holding, this allows you to fly across the whole stage!
N-air is quick and has good knockback, good move but doesn't hit all around you like most n-airs (7%)
F-air is incredible, launches forward at great speeds while dealing okay damage and good knockback, can easily combo into other moves both on the ground and in the air like n-air, or chain into another f-air, if he lands in the middle of doing f-air he'll slide really far along the ground, potentially letting him get close for a follow-up, changes distance based on what direction you're holding (4%)
B-air is an awkward punch that has pretty good knockback at high %s, isn't great until then (6%)
U-air has a good hitbox, but is a bit slow and sends opponents up, decent for juggling, but otherwise not great (6%)
D-air is a quick and powerful spike that opponents will learn to fear when below you, good for movement too, changes distance based on which direction you're holding (6%)
Grab has decent range and is quick, pummel deals 3% and has average speed, nice .. D-throw (7%) and U-throw (4%) are for combos, D-throw combos into more things so it's better ...  F-throw (5%) is decent for killing at the ledge at high %s .. B-throw (4%) is one of Incredible's strongest moves, sends opponents at a nasty downwards angle to help with edgeguarding, and can kill very early on it's own
In summery, if you want a close-up brawler that has something weird and unique to offer, give Mr. Incredible a try
