It's time for an Okita overview! Okita is fast, mediocre recovery, passable range, bad single-hit damage, and combos..A lot of combos, so many combos... They excel when fighting grounded opponents.. Let's go through all their moves one by one:
Their main core move is, believe it or not, Jab, it takes 3 button presses and does a fast single hit, then teleports behind to do 4 more hits, then teleports back to their original spot to finish them off with 2 more, you can cancel into any other non-special attack in the middle of this too, only the last hit combos into and out of their special attacks, which I'll go over now (1%x6, 3% = 9%):
N-Sp creates a low range projectile that if hit teleports behind the opponent and allows for any follow-up you can think of, use it to start or continue combos, doesn't work great if you end up in the air/off-stage, can't work at all if Okita is in the air (4% projectile, 1% teleport = 5%)
F-Sp dashes forwards with a slice before multiple more follow, launching the opponent into you for another follow-up, might not combo after the initial dash, but will do pretty good shield damage in that case (2% dash, 2%x4 follow-up, = 10%)
D-Sp normally is a counter attack into a teleport to start combos, but it can also be used right after most attacks, will still teleport behind the opponent similar to N-Sp landing, also doesn't work great in the air (5%) 
U-Sp is a rather poor recovery move which ends in a turnaround slice if the opponent gets hit, use it as a combo finisher sometimes (1%x9, 6% = 15%)
All their specials can only be done once per combo
Dash attack deals more damage at the base of the sword than the tip, and is the only grounded move that doesn't cancel to specials (5% tip/late, 9% otherwise)
F-tilt is fast and can start combos similar to jab, has a bigger hitbox, nothing special really (4%)
U-tilt is also fast with a nice hitbox, but has recovery if you whiff it, and doesn't combo well, not great.. (3%)
D-tilt same as the other tilts, fast, good hitbox, combos into and out of everything (3%)
N-air combos into whatever you want if you hit a grounded opponent.. It's not good in the air and has serious trouble connecting all hits (1%x3, 2% = 5%)
Take note that Okita's aerials all knockback more horizontally against a grounded foe, but more vertically against an airborne foe
F-air has okay range and can be used to kill grounded foes at high %s,(4%)
B-air has much better range than F-air, but a lot more recovery, looks like it turns Okita around but it actually doesn't, the front facing hit actually sends grounded foes upwards, and airborne foes horizontally (6%)
U-air is quick with a big hitbox, but it's best for juggling foes and not much else  (4%)
D-air is another quick move with a big hitbox, it's also even better at killing grounded foes than F-air, use it often at higher %s (5%)
All their smashes are quick and decently powerful with some noticeable recovery, great for KOing and finishing combos, can be comboed out of specials and jab of course, D-smash and F-smash can both cover the ledge well, use U-smash if you're not near a ledge, though (15% < 21% D-smash, 15% < 22% F-Smash/U-Smash)
Grab is somewhat short ranged, pummel (2%) is average, and obviously all their throws can cancel to specials too, F-throw (8%) and B-throw (8%) are best at it though, and U-throw (15%) despite dealing high damage, can only combo into F-Sp and D-Sp at lower %s, sadly D-throw (4%) is too weak to be of much use
So, in summery, if you like ground based fighters, and comboing for days with quick precise strikes, Okita is likely the one for you
