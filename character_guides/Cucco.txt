Cucco overview! They're just a weird chicken! The fact that I've made an overview for this thing means I'm coocoo! They excel at P e c k i n g
Jab peck (5%)
F-tilt moving peck best (5%)
U-tilt peck (5%)
D-tilt peck (5%)
Dash attack running peck good(5%)
F-smash big strong mega peck (10% < 18%)
U-smash big strong mega peck but you press up to do it (10% < 18%)
D-smash big strong mega peck but you don't press up to do it (10% < 18%)
N-Sp the legendary princess toss, genuinely great move, really strong and fast, but the opponent can grab her too! Can't throw down normally when grounded unless you do C-stick down, throws softer/harder if you tilt/smash the stick respectively (12%)
F-Sp mega ultra chicken blaster, obliterates shields, spam it (1%x4 = 4%)
U-Sp flies really far, full control, no hitbox but can cancel to other moves too sometimes
D-Sp does a magnificent chicken dance by mashing it, use to intimidate and terrify your foes.. If Cucco manages to survive beyond 100% damage though, it becomes a close up hitbox that deals massive damage! (20%) 
In addition to an improved D-Sp, if Cucco is at 100% or above, all it's attacks will deal double their normal damage!!
N-air flying peck (5%)
F-air aerial peck (5%)
B-air jumping peck (5%)
U-air leaping peck (5%)
D-air ascending peck (5%)
Grab has surprisingly good range, pummel (2%) is average, D-throw (12%) can follow-up on your foe easily .. U-throw (5%) is pretty useless and doesn't combo to stuff .. B-throw (15%) is for damage and positioning .. F-throw (9%) kills at the ledge
In summery: I like chickens, Eddy
