Aru overview time?? Aru is a bunny person holding a sack of goodies, got 10 total jumps because bunnies are good at jumping, and they've likely got rabbit feet, which is said to be a good luck charm for some reason, and good luck is exactly what you will need to play them well
All moves other than N-Sp/F-Sp/U-Sp do a sack whack that is very fast, good range, lasts for a while, can easily combo into itself over and over, and does seemingly random damage and knockback every time Aru swings it, ranging from 1% - 6% damage
N-Sp/F-Sp/U-Sp all do the same thing: take a second to reach into the bag and pull out a random item, tossing it on the ground nearby, even if all items are disabled in the match settings, this has the potential to wildly swing the match into someone else's favor, but Aru doesn't really need the items usually with their sack whack being so strong already, unless the opponent is trying to stall her out, then Aru can just keep spamming items and force them to come closer
Grabs? Throws? They're too busy carrying the sack to bother with grabbing people
In summery: may lady luck be with you if you intend to pick Aru and swing that sack around
