Perfect Cell overview time! He's a tall and handsome fellow, both fast and strong, he is one to be feared, though he is not unbeatable and has a couple weaknesses, he can struggle at longer range and has a poor vertical recovery, he excels at pressuring opponents and edgeguarding
By holding the jump button, he has access to a 4 second long hover where he can still perform attacks while floating around, you can hold down at any time to cancel your jump and go into a hover, including crouching before jumping to hover and do air attacks right near the ground
Jab is 4 hits, quick and powerful with decent range, can even kill at higher %s, you can hold the button down for the 2nd button press to do the rest easier (2%, 2%, 3%, 5%  = 12%)
F-tilt is similarly quick, powerful, and has good range, can also kill at high %s, pretty good (7%)
U-tilt is one of Cell's main killing moves, very fast and strong, only downside is it's poor range, which you can solve by initiating a dash just before doing it, causing Cell to move forward a good distance (8%)
D-tilt slides along the ground, has good reach that can be improved by dashing beforehand just like U-tilt, decent as a far range punish or to guard the ledge (6%)
Dash attack is relatively weak until pretty high %s, and doesn't really combo to anything either, best to go for something else most of the time (8%) 
F-Smash has great range and is slightly stronger than F-tilt, but is of course slower, nice to have as an option to keep your foes on their toes (15% < 21%)
U-Smash is even slower than F-Smash, but goes at an upwards angle, great to use against an airborne foe, obviously, though it's not as strong as U-tilt (15% < 21%)
D-Smash has comparable range to F-Smash, but is a series of 3 explosions great for edgeguarding or catching landings, pretty good aside from the recovery which can leave you vulnerable if the move whiffs entirely (4%x3 = 12% < 4%, 4%, 10% = 18%)
N-Sp charges up and fires a powerful straight beam that deals strong knockback and fine damage vs shields too, can be angled downwards only in the air by holding down, or back to straight by holding up, you can freely move around with hover while using this move (and D-Sp too!) (15%)
F-Sp has Cell charge forwards, does nothing vs shields but if it hits will do a combination attack that ends with a powerful spiking hit, extremely effective to use while off-stage, it can also aid in horizontal recovery, but can only be done once in the air (20%)
U-Sp is a short ranged and kinda slow teleport in any direction with no hitbox and can't automatically grab the ledge, this is awful and Cell's only major flaw on his otherwise perfect record
D-Sp charges up for a second then creates a large explosive wave around Cell to blow enemies away, absolutely amazing for attacking recovering foes, use it every chance you get if they're off-stage and you're near the ledge! (12%)
N-air has a fairly small hitbox but lasts a while and can combo to stuff if it hits a grounded foe at low %s, at higher %s it's good for simply knocking foes away (7%)
F-air is similar to N-air but it doesn't last as long and can combo to grounded moves at later %s, isn't as good to use at high %s though (5%)
B-air is a bit slow but really strong and has good range, use it often at high %s (10%)
U-air is basically a weaker U-tilt, still very strong though, especially if you can catch someone high up with it, use it often then (7%)
D-air has a powerful spiking hit right at the start, and a late hit with much less knockback, the late hit can at least combo to jab/grab/tilts if it hits on the ground (13% start, 6% late)
Grab is short ranged but Cell is quick so it's not a huge issue, pummel (2%) is a little faster than average .. F-throw (12%) is good for damage and KOing horizontally .. B-throw (10%) is similar to f-throw but slightly worse across the board, with less knockback, damage, worse angle, and more recovery, still good though .. U-throw (8%) is just U-tilt but in grab form, so it's amazing .. D-throw (14%) is good for damage and can spike off-stage, can also sometimes combo to D-tilt, pretty nice
In summery: If you want to experience perfection and feel really powerful, Mr. Perfect Cell is the man for the job
