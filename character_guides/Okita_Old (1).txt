Okita (old) overview time! This alt form of Okita Soji, "Oldkita" plays quite differently, so much so that she requires a separate overview!
Oldkita is basically an entirely different fighter, almost the reverse of Okita, whereas Okita wants you grounded and relies on jabs, Oldkita is at home in the air! They still excel at combos, as well as being very fast
Their jab is a huge downgrade in comparison to their alt form, though it can still start combos, notably with u-tilt, n-sp, and u-air (4%)
F-tilt is quick and pops the opponent upwards, but it can't start combos well, should go for other moves instead usually (4%)
U-tilt is a fantastic move, combos into itself and then into U-air, U-Sp, and N-Sp (6%)
D-tilt is another great combo starter, combos into U-tilt, F-Smash, and N-Sp no matter the %! Only flaw is it's very short range, which you can remedy by dashing just before doing this move, amazing! (7%)
Dash attack deals more damage at the base of the sword than the tip (5% tip/late, 9% otherwise)
All their smashes are quick and decently powerful with some noticeable recovery, great for KOing of course, D-smash and F-smash can both cover the ledge well, use U-smash if you're not near a ledge, though (15% < 21% D-smash, 15% < 22% F-Smash/U-Smash)
F-Sp charges up for a moment before unleashing a single strong slash, good for KOing and recovering but can't really combo (11%)
U-Sp launches up while swinging, okay for finishing combos, but that's risky, best use as a recovery (10%)
N-Sp has Oldkita jump forward and spin around, similar to Okita's jab, they can cancel anything out of it at any point if it hits, except N-Sp and D-Sp, great for starting/continuing combos, can cancel to an aerial in the middle to launch themselves forward at a high speed, get creative with this move! (2%x4, 6% = 15%)
All Oldkita's aerials can cancel to specials, including on whiff!
N-air does a quick stomp that can cancel to all other aerials and specials, if you press any other aerial after, it will pop Oldkita up a bit to stay in the air, can combo into and out of N-Sp, very good move (4%)
F-air is mainly used as a combo tool after N-Sp or something (6%)
D-air, your primary combo move after N-air due to it's decent hitbox (5%)
B-air is your main killing move, slow to start but hurts a lot (8%)
U-air is great for combos, goes into itself and U-Sp easily (4%)
Down Special: Oldkita's down special can only be activated while the symbol at the bottom is glowing green, it recovers after about 8 seconds of being grey.. Once you press down special, Oldkita gains a massive speed boost for ~10 seconds, especially grounded but in the air too, in addition to this, their N-Sp and U-Sp will go further, you can even activate it in mid-air to get back to the stage easier if you want!
...And the startup/recovery of all their air normals will be greatly reduced, turning them into a true terror of the skies! Their U-air will chain even more, D-air can be spammed freely, N-air combos into things better, and B-air becomes far more dangerous as it's greatest flaw of long startup is mitigated, furthermore, due to the greatly improved ground speed, you can suddenly rush in for a grab, or a jab/tilt to start a combo!
Grab has short range, but Oldkita is fast so it's alright, pummel (2%) is average speed, F-throw (7%) can combo to U-tilt and U-air at low-mid %s .. B-throw (8%) can't combo but is decently strong at high %s .. U-throw (6%) sends straight up to start juggling .. D-throw (10%) sends up and forwards and is also good for juggling, but can't combo
In summery: Oldkita is a fun and unique character in their own right, if you like jumping around, fishing for combos, and moving crazy fast some of the time, give them a try
