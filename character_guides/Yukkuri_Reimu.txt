Yukkuri Reimu (Yuk for short, an alt form of Reimu Hakurei) is a completely normal fighter with a fully functional all-around moveset, other than the fact that she is just a giant head, but she won't such meaningless limitations stop her from kicking butt! She excels at whatever a bouncing head wants to do, and can fight at any range well
Yuk's jab obviously launches a fist then a foot from her mouth, the fist has a smaller hitbox only on the arm, and can push foes out of range of the foot, at least the foot has good knockback at high %s and doesn't require the fist to land to come out, mediocre overall (4%, 6% = 10%)
F-tilt throws a card(?) out in front of her, can combo into air moves, great range and a great move (2x4 = 8%)
U-tilt throws out a large square in an arc, good for harassment, but has no knockback and only flinches the opponent, nice for edgeguarding at least (4%)
D-tilt splits the head open horizontally to reveal two smaller Yuks inside, great knockback, but at higher %s won't hit with both hits (3, 5 = 8%)
Dash attack has an early hit and a late hit, the late hit deals less damage and knockback but combos into grab and such at lower %s, very good (10% early, 7% late)
F-Smash is extremely slow to start but launches a super strong projectile that flies really fast across the stage, amazing to land against a recovering foe (5% < 14%)
U-smash, a weaker D-tilt that splits vertically for less range and has more recovery, sadly this move is nearly useless.. (3 < 10%)
D-Smash, burrows underground and becomes invincible while charging, then rises up and unleashes a powerful strike all around herself, incredible move, especially for punishing close attacks, hits twice and knockbacks in the opposite direction she's facing (9, 9 = 18% < 16, 17 = 33%)
N-Sp: rapid-fires cards(?) that deal minor damage and don't flinch, similar to Fox's lasers but better and you don't have to mash the button, great for long range harassment (1% each)
F-Sp: summons a max of 5 micro-Yuks by holding the special button, or micro-Marisas by lightly tapping the special button, that either rush along the ground or fly up in the sky respectively, they move semi-randomly and will disappear after a little while, they do great damage to shields but can lose to other projectiles, outstanding move (3% each)
U-Sp: a simple leap up with no hitbox, bad but at least it doesn't leave you helpless
D-Sp: ignites a fuse, exploding herself after a second and taking 15% damage for a deadly hitbox all around her, extremely powerful but slow to start and quite risky, can spike at just the right angles (15% self, 25% foe)
N-air: very quick with a decent hitbox, but doesn't send anywhere nor easily combos into things, not the best (5%)
F-air: almost as fast as N-air with better damage and knockback, very nice (7%)
B-air: really powerful, easily kills at the ledge, it's a bit slower than the others and has a smaller hitbox, but it's still relatively easy to land, great move (8%)
U-air: can kill at very high %s, otherwise a decent option for juggling opponents and chaining into itself, nice to have (10%)
D-air: bounces off of opponents on hit/shield, letting you chain into itself or retreat to safety, can probably combo to other air moves too, amazing (8%)
Grab is fine, has alright range, pummel is average speed and 2% damage, all her throws are pretty basic: D-throw spikes at the ledge (6%), F-throw knocks people off the ledge (9%), U-throw sends them high into the air (7%), B-throw kills near the ledge (8%)
In summery, if you want to play as a giant weird head thing that surprisingly has a lot of things going for her despite her lack of a body, pick Yukkuri Reimu
