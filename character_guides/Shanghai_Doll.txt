Shanghai Doll overview time! They're a very smol fighter with somewhat slow movement and a very poor recovery despite being able to jump a total of 5 times, but they're incredibly dangerous when up close, able to tear through shields and enemies alike with a flurry of strikes, they excel at pressuring opponents
Jab is amazing despite it's short range, does incredibly high shield damage and can combo into many other moves, such as f-tilt, d-tilt, d-air, f-air, grab, and jab again, use it all the time, you can only stop on every 5th hit (1% per hit, min 5 hits)
F-tilt is like a moving jab, except it has an additional final hit with some knockback, but it's very rare to hit with it, it's okay (1%x5, 2% = 7%)
U-tilt has decent range, but doesn't really combo, nor kill, it's okay I guess (4%)
D-tilt has very poor range, and is basically just a weaker dash attack, not really worth it most of the time if you can get a run going (9%)
Dash attack is surprisingly powerful and has way more range than it looks, able to protect Doll's head and either side nicely, a great move (9%)
F-Smash is rather slow with mediocre range, use it if you get a shield break, otherwise it's not that good (15% < 22%)
U-Smash is an incredible anti-air that can kill and deal great damage too, but the problem is that it's nearly impossible to get all the hits to land, especially if you charge it, this move can be improved with a technique I call a "hop-smash", if you simply jump and land, or do any aerial action and recover before you hit the ground, you can then do an U-smash with full aerial control during it, you can even use an U-smash into another U-smash for this! If you hold forward as you land you can store the hop-smash as long as you want until you release forward or do any other action (20% if all 6 hits land < 63% 6 hits)
D-Smash is like a slightly slower and stronger version of dash attack, so it's really good (14% < 22%)
N-Sp sends out 5 projectiles one after the other in a spread, these do great shield damage and can even combo into stuff if you're at the right distance, if you're close enough they'll instead home in on where the opponent last was (1% per shot)
F-Sp spins the Doll, dealing fine knockback with a nice hitbox as well, even helps you recover horizontally and combos out of jab, a fantastic move aside from the damage (0.5%x8 = 4%)
U-Sp is a complete joke, does a pathetic hop up with no hitbox and a lot of recovery, doesn't even snap to the ledge, making this strictly a detriment unless you absolutely have to land on the stage and not the ledge...
D-Sp summons another Doll to your aid, will slowly walk forward, but start running once close to their foe, will even jump towards them if they're in the air, once reaching them it will explode, you can combo this with N-Sp or b-air for long range harassment, or use it to rush in, very nice, will jump first if you summon it in the air (10%)
N-air is just like jab but in the air, even better since you can move around while swinging away, you smoothly transition to jab upon landing (1% per hit, min 5 hits)
F-air is quick and deals good damage, has okay knockback, and a ton of recovery for some reason, you can control yourself in the air while doing it, but it's not worth the risk off-stage (9%)
B-air slowly fires an arrow, does decent damage, and will still fire even if you land on the ground first, is kinda unlikely to hit though.. Also turns you around (10%)
D-air sends both fighters down really far and can be bad for opponents off-stage, as well as you if you're not careful..On-stage it's even more deadly and can combo to several things, including jab and itself over and over, it also combos from jab, you can keep this going for a while if you're skilled enough probably (4%)
Grab is quick and has pretty good psychic range, pummel (2%) is average speed, F-throw (6%) is mostly for positioning until really high %s where it can kill.. U-throw (6%) can kill off the top pretty nicely but shouldn't be used until high %s since it has a lot of recovery .. D-throw (7%) is for positioning since it doesn't kill as early as your other throws and can't combo, not great .. B-throw (8%) is Doll's strongest move and should be used liberally at mid-high %s to at the least get your foe off-stage, it's fantastic
In summery: If you want to run up and hug everyone you meet whether they want it or not, or send in a clone to do that for you, Shanghai Doll is the one for you
