Kahn you believe it's a Kahn overview!? Kahn has a lot of things going for him, great speed, attack range, nice recovery, and excels at hit & run tactics..But his damage output is frankly pretty terrible ..Regardless, let's see what this swift swordsman can do:
Jab is a single kick that can combo into whatever at low-mid %s, including grab, U-Sp, and F-tilt (2%)
F-tilt is a swift long range stab that sends the opponent decently far, great poking move (5%)
U-tilt is a large anti-air swing that doesn't send far and has noticable recovery, can combo into U-Sp sometimes, not too great otherwise (4%)
D-tilt can be pressed 3 times, the last hit has some knockback, but the first 2 can potentially push the opponent out of range..The first 2 hits can combo into U-Sp even at high %s, allowing for a kill combo, very nice (1%, 1%, 3%)
Dash attack is another kick, but it sends the opponent far away, it's okay for getting them off-stage, but it doesn't combo into anything (3%)
F-smash uncharged has similar knockback to F-tilt, but it deals more damage at least, it's a pretty good move (9% - 17%)
U-smash is stronger in knockback than F-smash, and covers a huge area above you, but deals less damage, try to only use this if it'll kill, since it has substantial startup and recovery (4% - 8%)
D-smash is even slower than U-smash, and sends very little distance on a hit unless the opponent is off-stage, then it can kill quite easily, but if you hit it on-stage, you can at least combo into U-Sp or F-Sp, not really worth it though since you can't cancel to a special if it whiffs.. (7% - 13%)
N-air is a sweeping slice around Kahn, nice hitbox like the rest of his moves, but it's unusually slow to start, deals too little damage and knockback to make it worth it.. (4%)
F-air is great, like a faster F-tilt that has less knockback, can combo into stuff like grab at low-mid %s if you hit a grounded foe (5%)
B-air is also great, has a better F-smash's hitbox that hits everywhere underneath him as well, and even more knockback than its uncharged version, very nice (9%)
U-air is like U-tilt but it has more knockback, another good move that can juggle enemies easily (4%)
D-air is amazing, and one of your main kill moves, a lingering spiking hitbox that puts fear into off-stage enemies! (7%)
N-Sp has Kahn spin at high speeds, becoming a whirling hitbox, glides through the air, can control it with left/right, will automatically stop after a certain time or after hitting the opponent 3 times, or if it hits a shield once, the last hit has higher knockback, great for recovering (2%, 2%, 2%)
F-Sp, Kahn dashes forwards, automatically doing a huge slash after a certain time or if the opponent gets within range, can cancel to N-Sp or U-Sp on hit for a combo at low %'s, otherwise isn't worth it.. Can kinda help with recovering but has lots of recovery time to deal with (4%)
U-Sp, Kahn does a giant swing while leaping upwards, can kill at high %s, very nice move, great for recovering, especially if you know how to B-reverse, by lightly tapping B you'll do a single swing that doesn't put you into Helplessness, but if you hold it you'll go higher and do multiple hits but become helpless, you should do hold B after the tap version for the best chance at recovering (tap 4%,   hold, 1%, 1%, 3%)
D-Sp, a counter-attack, it's extremely slow to start up though and can't usually kill, upon landing a hit you'll gain a little sword icon, get enough and it makes the counter startup faster..Not a great move until you already have several swords (varies %, min 10%)
F-Sp+Atk (A button & B button together) causes Khan to dash forward just like F-Sp, but with a low swing that stuns and can combo to all other specials, huge recovery if you whiff or don't cancel though, pretty good (7%)
Kahn's grab is amazing, the grabbox is massive and lasts a while, his pummel is also amazing, being quite quick and dealing 2% per strike, yes Kahn's highest DPS is by using pummel.. F-throw is an incredible kill throw and great for sending off-stage too, D-throw and U-throw both can combo into specials, and B-throw can send off-stage too but won't usually kill
In summery, if you want to be really fast, poke and slice with amazing hitboxes, and have to hit your foe a lot to finally KO them, Kahn is the swordsman for you
