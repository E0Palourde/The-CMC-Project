It's the moment y'all all have been waiting for: I'm gonna write about Mugino!
Mugino is a heavyweight setplay zoner with exceptional stage control thanks to her green lazers that cover the entire stage 
She triggers these abominations by pressing neutral special or usmash
She can both angle the lazers 45 degrees up and down, as well as charge them up
These lazers also have high priority, so most enemy projectiles get vaporized
However, they come out frame 20, so it's a bad idea to mash B up close
Angled downwards catches grounded approaches and upwards makes platforms a no-fly zone
Lazers do from 2 to 10 damage when they hit, as well as slight knockback
Since they're a fullscreen tool, lazers also work terrifically for edgeguarding
Side special is like a reflecting prism which expands the lazers' trajectory in a fan pattern
You can toss it out after you fire a lazer, keeping your poor opponent guessing
Down special is a reflector wall a la Reimu
You jump backwards after using it, granting you an extra microspacing option
This move is great for controlling the stage and setting up for combos
Since it's a stationary hitbox, it's possible to smack your foe into it, leaving them at the perfect angle for followups
Up special is an energy-coated tackle that can be used in the air twice
It's one of her most important KO moves
It has some startup, so you can't mash it.  If you thought you could throw out a frame 15 move without thinking, guess again
Before I move on to her other moves, here's a reminder that zoners either have long-ranged, slow normals (like Link and Belmonts) or surprisingly stubby ones (like Athena and Young Link). Mugino falls under the latter category 
Her normals are honestly little to write home about
Since she uses JUS sprites, they're largely a collection of generic punches and slaps
Her jab is frame 3 at least, giving her the ability to box up close
It's your standard 3 piece combo jab, nothing special
All 3 tilts are random slaps that lack range and honestly are just filler in the grand scheme of things
Utilt can set up for aerial combos so there's that
Usmash is vertical neutral special that can't be angled
dash attack is a running tackle with decent knockback 
Can kill at late percents
It's frame 6, so a much better burst option than up special
fsmash is a glorified pimpslap with like no range
It kills at late percents
dsmash is 2 huge energy bursts on both sides of her. Good for catching rolls. Kills sometimes
Her aerials are much the same as her tilts: generic slaps for the most part
Uair and fair are good for juggling and can quickly build up the percent
Nair is a decent forward approaching tool
It's frame 5 and lingers for 3 frames
Bair is a burst of energy a la dsmash but behind her
Shifts her momentum forward, but comes out frame 15
Dair is basically Diddy Kong's
Throws are also nothing to write home about, though dthrow and fthrow kill at the ledge at late percents
Overall, your gameplan with Mugino is to frustrate your opponent with lazers from every angle
If someone breaks through your defense, you can use your relatively fast normals to build up damage for a bit, but try to get back to zoning ASAP
Mugino is most threatening when you're recovering, then long range, then upclose
Her major weaknesses are a paltry midrange game, her poor mobility, ability to get comboed, and her less-than-stellar kill power
If you have a ranged normal faster than frame 20 or a quick projectile, you can takes advantage of any gaps in he lazer coverage and go to town
She's too slow to effectively run away, so powershield the down b wall 
She also isn't particularly threatening directly above her, though you do run the risk of juggles
You can try to circle camp her
Or suffocate her with rushdown
If you're a Mugino in disadvantage, you can toss out aerials or reflector wall if possible
Try to start a combo of your own
You can try to play rushdown with some effectiveness
These flaws are why Mugino is actually a horrid lag pick
You're much too slow to effectively run away, and your normals are fairly precise
You also have few reliable kill buttons off a read
Offline or when the connection is crisp, Mugino is sure to frustrate the hell out of your opponent and leave them with some bad memories if they're noobs. I don't recommend you show her to new players until you've played a few matches and they're having fun
Enjoy your green lazer girl!
