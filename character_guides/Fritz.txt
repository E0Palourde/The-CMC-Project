Old sword guy overview time! Fritz likes to take things at his own pace, a snail's pace, having dreadfully slow attacks and awkward movement, as well as being forced to use Brawl type airdodge, but he hurts like nothing else, rewarded with crazy high damage if he can ever land a blow, he excels at hitting really really hard
Jab is his weakest and fastest move, can combo into itself at lower %s, and is okay at getting people off of you if you're being pressured, but it's not the best (3%)
F-tilt has good range and damage, but won't be killing easily, and it has some recovery, overall it's a decent poke (13%)
U-tilt is similar to F-tilt, but it's a bit slower and deals more damage, a little hard to hit but decent as well (16%)
D-tilt is great, quick to start, reaches further than other tilts, and can easily kill, but it has some nasty recovery (20%)
Dash attack is a wimpy short kick, only really combos into jab, could go for an attack/grab mix-up after perhaps, but you run so slowly anyways, not good (4%)
F-smash is super slow and super strong, risky but worth it sometimes (35% < 40%)
U-smash is great for dealing damage, and can be a good anti-air, but that's about it since it can't kill too well and it has massive recovery (42% < 52%)
D-smash is about as slow as the other smashes, but it also deals the lowest damage and can't kill, don't use it much, can control where you go by holding left/right (31% < 36%)
N-Sp is a counter, it's very awkward and tight with it's timing, if close you'll do a stunning slash and allow for a follow-up, otherwise you'll do an invincible F-Sp, too difficult to be worth it in most cases (15%)
F-Sp, U-Sp, and D-Sp, all can be canceled from every one of Fritz's other attacks before the hitbox comes out, aside from specials and grabs
F-Sp sends Fritz dashing forward at inhuman speeds, recovering quickly and allowing you to get in on a foe, but you can't cancel it in any way once you start it, so you might overshoot or run into an attack, can dash up to 3 times in the air, shared with U-Sp and you get all 3 again once you land or get hit in the air .. If you tap forward + Sp while you're hanging on a ledge, you'll get a seemingly invincible F-Sp, that can cancel to other specials after by continuing to hold the Sp button + a direction
U-Sp is similar to F-Sp, except you go up, obviously amazing for recovering, can angle it slightly by holding left/right just after starting
D-Sp on the ground does a quick hop back then returns to your original spot, great for canceling the start of moves into, and is invincible, so you can use it kinda like a spotdodge, in the air it dashes downwards and you can do this as much as you want unlike the other two
N-air is a really quick kick that sends the opponent away, it's not great but it's your only offensive option to get the opponent off of you while airborne (7%)
F-air is slow but strong, can kill too, but is awkward to land (19%), 
B-air is similar but has a bigger hitbox, worse knockback, and deals way more damage, use it often over F-air (27%)
U-air isn't great, it can't kill and doesn't have an easy time hitting above, mediocre (13%)
D-air is too slow, it's similar to D-smash, but a little faster with less damage, not worth it most of the time (26%)
Grab has mediocre range, you'll want to use F-Sp to get in there for it, the pummel is uniquely slow but powerful, dealing (9%) each time, D-throw (11%) moves forward and sets your opponent onto the ground or even in the air if there's none around, decent.. B-throw (13%) fine to throw off-stage, but is outclassed by .. F-throw (16%) basically just a stronger B-throw, nice .. U-throw (15%) can kill quite easily off the top, even stronger than U-smash for some reason..
In summery: If you always wanted swords in games to cause realistic life threatening injury with each swing, Fritz is going to make your dream come true
