Bankai Ichigo (BI) overview time! This is what happens when you press D-Sp again while your meter is full as regular Ichigo, hold D-Sp while it's not full to charge the meter, it takes 10 seconds to reach max charge unless you dealt some damage first, and while in this state he becomes far more agile, having faster movement all-around, and a whopping 5 total jumps! But he's not necessarily any better at killing, this form normally lasts around 30 seconds, and you'll lose it instantly if Ichigo is KOed, he still excels at hit & run, but also at pressuring foes
Jab is a quick 2 hit series, the 2nd hit is decently powerful with a great all-around hitbox, can cancel into any other move too for a combo, including tilts and F-Sp, a nice upgrade (3%, 7% = 10%)
F-tilt is similarly fast with a nice hitbox, can go for another attack after, but it likely won't true combo (7%)
U-tilt has a surprising amount of horizontal range, but lacks in the full coverage that regular Ichigo (RI) provided, can chain multiple of itself at low %s (4%)
D-tilt steps forward before hitting all-around BI, can't combo into anything and doesn't send too far until really high %s, an unfortunate downgrade (4%)
Dash attack slides forwards before hitting in front, it can miss opponents that are too close, and doesn't knock back as far as RI's, another unfortunate downgrade (6%)
All of BI's Smash attacks can be improved with a technique I call a "hop-smash", if you simply jump and land, or do any aerial action and recover before you hit the ground, you can then do a smash (including charged ones) with full aerial control during it, If you hold forward as you land you can store the hop-smash as long as you want until you release forward or do any other action
F-Smash does a big leap forward and ends in a powerful swing, a very nice move that can kill rather effectively, during a hop-smash you can hold backwards to not leap as far (12% < 20%)
U-Smash jumps up a bit and spikes foes, another great move if you can use it on a recovering foe, the hop-smash influence you have is minimal due to the short time in the air, but it can still help out (14% < 22%)
D-Smash has a large hitbox around BI, but doesn't do great knockback, the more upwards angle it sends at compared to RI's doesn't help at all, but the hop-smash benefits you get are extreme, allowing you to greatly increase the move's range, you can even leap off of platforms with it to attack in the air! (12% < 20%)
N-Sp is much improved over RI's despite it's lowered damage, it's faster and always launches horizontally, it still takes forever to charge and isn't really worth the effort, but in the air it fires diagonally downwards and can kill off-stage foes, making it truly deadly! (3% < 6% ground, 4% air)
F-Sp is much the same as RI's, launches you forward with good knockback and can be charged to go further, but it doesn't put you into freefall anymore, greatly improving your recovery and allowing you to stall high in the air until your BI meter runs out (5% < 15%)
U-Sp launches BI up and forwards, doesn't put him into freefall anymore, but still doesn't snap to the ledge, it's also somewhat worse at defending from threats above, if you're near your opponent and you press Sp again, you'll instantly cancel the U-Sp and get launched in whatever direction they're in, you can combo stuff from this but it's very unreliable, aside from Z-air (2%x5 = 10%)
D-Sp drains your meter by about 10% per use, quick short range attack that shreds through shields, very nice to have around (1%x5, 6% = 11%)
N-air is fast, but doesn't have RI's great n-air hitbox, it's also weaker and unable to combo as easy, not very good (6%)
F-air doesn't dash quite the same as RI's, making it a little awkward to use, especially since the attack part comes out slower, mediocre move (8%)
B-air is pretty much the same as RI's, rather weak and hits behind then both in front and behind, fairly nice (5%)
U-air is also the same as RI's but you have 5 jumps now, so it's juggling potential is much higher, great (4%)
D-air is thankfully like RI's, still an amazing move, even better now that you have more aerial mobility, use it often! (4%)
Z-air (neutral grab in the air) can only be done once until you hit the ground again and drains about 20% of your meter, has a large range and teleports above the opponent's current position to strike, this is great for a surprise attack or comboing after you hit with U-Sp or something, it can combo after to other moves occasionally too, such as U-tilt or U-air (7%)
Grab is quick with decent range, pummel (2%) is average speed, D-throw (4%) is not good, just kinda a worse version of ... F-throw (7%) can combo into various moves like jab and D-Sp at low-mid %s, and knock off-stage at high %s, great .. B-throw (15%) can't kill and is just for damage and positioning .. U-throw (5%) combos into lots of things at low-mid %s, including jab, U-tilt, aerials, D-Sp, etc. very good
In summery: both forms have ups and downs, but you'll generally want to be in BI most of the time of course, be sure to check out the regular Ichigo overview too if you havn't
