Sans overview, the easiest enemy, he can only deal 1 damage! Mr. funny skeleton man is the ultimate glass cannon, having unrivaled damage per second and fantastic range, but being the lightest member of the entire 250+ fighter roster, he also struggles to kill unless up close, which is super dangerous for him.. He excels at zoning and judging you for your sins
He can hover in the air for about 3 seconds by holding the jump button, can hover on the ground by holding down along with jump
Jab is 3 quick hits, the 1st hit has worse range than the other two but will hit right in front of Sans as well, the 3rd hit buries grounded foes and spikes airborne ones, really good (1%x3 = 3%)
F-tilt is incredible, sends out large bones all across the platform Sans is standing on with massive range, and also sometimes on platforms below it too? Might just need to experiment with it yourself to see what it'll do, great for racking up damage, harassing, and even killing at very high %s (1% per frame, averages between 7 - 21%)
U-tilt sends a spinning bone upwards, before it suddenly dives sharply downwards, great for covering your head (1%x11 = 11%)
D-tilt makes bones appear on the floor, dealing great damage and no knockback, but it seemingly messes with enemy attacks and makes them not work as good? Decent move if you have the time (1%x14 = 14%)
Dash attack is pretty powerful, but not as powerful as F-smash, and requires you to be right up close, which Sans doesn't want to do much of the time, so it's not really all that good (1%)
F-smash is powerful but kinda slow, could mean you just die if you miss it, and the range sucks, you'll have to break a shield or bury or something to land it (1%)
U-smash is is a bigger slower U-tilt, deals great damage and the bone flies straight up after spinning to further protect you from airborne threats, charging this smash doesn't seem to do anything special though (1%x44 = 44%)
D-smash hits grounded opponents from anywhere on the stage, knocking them up a bit, but when fully charged it buries grounded foes and spikes airborne ones, this is pretty nice (1%)
N-Sp is Sans' signature move, summons a Gaster Blaster to blast foes at long range for huge damage and shield damage, can easily be spammed for more and more blasts, and has no recovery at all, use this move literally all the time (1%x11 = 11%)
F-Sp manipulates gravity, pulling opponents close to you if you're facing them or pushing them away if you're not from any range, can be nice to use against a recovering opponent to push them away from the ledge or something
U-Sp teleports, really quick and can be used twice in a row before landing, nice recovery and has potential for mix-ups, with no teleports left, can be mashed to stall your fall
D-Sp is a counter, teleporting Sans behind the opponent and stunning them for a bit, allowing him to do jab, grab, F-Smash, whatever, he can also do it any time a Gaster blaster is on screen, but it won't stun then
N-air is a slow all-around hit that stuns for a tiny bit, not worth going for since the stun usually doesn't lead to anything (1%)
F-air is a really quick kick with decent knockback, can combo into grab on grounded foes at low %s, has a late hit too with much less knockback, can hold (1% early, 7% late ..Seven?? What??)
B-air is great, sends out a backwards spinning bone that multi-hits, then goes forward and usually only hits once, unless the opponent was comboed with the spinning portion, then it drags them forward along for a bit? Seems a bit random on what it'll do, but it's nice to spam, especially if you hover low to the ground (1% per frame, varies damage, max is ~46%)
U-air has Sans hold his hands out for a long time, dunking on caught opponents, obviously best off-stage, nice move, but leaves you vulernable with your hands out for a while if you miss (1%)
D-air calls bones down to whatever platform is below Sans, allowing you to hit grounded foes while in the air, this is great obviously, very similar to d-tilt (1%x14 = 14%)
Grab has long range and is fairly quick, pummel (1%) is average speed .. F-throw (1%) and B-throw (1%) are good for killing, especially at the ledge, U-throw (1%) kills off the top, and      D-throw (14%) is for damage
In summery: If you want something really unique and annoying for your opponents to fight, give this skeleton a try, but careful not to get hit or else you'll have a bad time!
