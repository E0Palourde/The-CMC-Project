Asuka overview time! She's a technical fast paced aerial-combo-focused fighter that has some damage and killpower issues but also some pretty sweet stuff, she's got fantastic horizontal recovery potential and excels at combos and pressuring her opponent
Z-air: During certain moves a distinct sound and a green circle will appear, you can simply hold Z-air (grab in mid-air) before/while that circle is there to home in on your opponent and knock them up a little bit to keep a combo going, this is generally great to have, but note that F-air's circle only works if you havn't used Z-air within the combo already
Jab is very quick and 3 button presses, it can be canceled out of just before the last hit with perfect timing into a smash attack, most useful of which is U-Smash, leading to big combos, while the other two smashes can kill, it's incredible (1%x10, 2% last hit = 11%)
F-tilt is also quick, a bit more range than jab, and good to repeatedly use on shields, has decent knockback too, fairly good (4%)
U-tilt is good to chain into itself, and also aerials as well at mid-high %s, nice (4%)
D-tilt is great to chain into itself and other moves, even more-so than U-tilt since it can combo to grabs, jabs, and such, also has a wide hitbox that can catch rollers, incredible (3%) 
Dash attack is awkwardly slow, but it can kill and deals good damage, so that's nice, only worth it at mid-high %s though (9%)
F-Smash hits right in front then sends out some earth a little away, has okay range and damage, mediocre knockback but you can't get much better (10% blade, 4% earth = 14% < 18% blade, 11% earth = 29%)
U-Smash is great for starting/continuing combos, as it leaps you into the air and creates a green circle to Z-air from, though it's not needed until higher %s, and this move is not for killing either (8% < 16%) 
D-Smash is slow and hits on both sides of Asuka, can kill decently well, it's passable (12% < 18%)
N-Sp is decent for KOing vertically and can aid in horizontal recovery, it can combo after Z-air most of the time, leading to high % kill combos (4%)
F-Sp is decent for KOing vertically and can aid in horizontal and vertical recovery, a little hard to hit with all 4 attacks, it can also combo after Z-air and kills a little earlier due to rising in the air (1%x3, 2% last hit = 5%)
U-Sp has no hitbox and turns you into a large seemingly invincible frog that puts you into freefall after, about as good as can be for an attackless recovery
D-Sp launches you down while spiking airborne foes and burying grounded ones, then raises up with a green circle attack, this is pretty slow with a small-ish hitbox, but also your strongest attack, good luck landing it, also stops having a hitbox if you fall far enough.. (13% fall, 8% rise = 21%)
N-air is a long lasting short range attack that has some recovery unless you cancel it, it can cancel into specials, F-air, U-air, and D-air, if you try to cancel to B-air it'll just do backwards drifting F-air, falling to the ground with it can let you combo to grab and jab, great move (3%)
F-air is your best aerial, it has 3 buttons to it like jab that move Asuka up a bit, the 3rd hit causes a green circle but only works if you havn't already used Z-air in your current combo, unlike the other circles, it can cancel to U-air and D-air on any of the 3 hits, but can only cancel to specials on the 3rd hit, you can repeatedly do just the first 2 hits in the air to stall a bit and aid in horizontal recovery (2%, 2%, 3% = 7%)
B-air is slow and can't cancel to anything, but it's okay for knockback/killing at very high %s, not great otherwise.. (8%)
U-air is quick but kinda weak, has some knockback at high %s, making combos harder, it can cancel to D-air and specials (4%)
D-air is a really fast combo finisher that requires precision, even though it hits all around Asuka, it's quite difficult to land all 8 hits, but it's your most damaging fast attack and pretty safe to do off-stage, will do the last hit upon touching the ground (2%x7, 4% last hit = 18%)
Grab is very short range with a bit of recovery too.. Pummel (2%) is average speed, B-throw (12%) is just for positioning and not really worth it .. F-throw (8%) is actually fairly strong and can kill vertically quite nicely 
U-throw (13%) and D-throw (16%) both create green circles (which you will need to do to actually combo with these) and are obviously your best throws, U-throw at low %s since it can combo to falling N-air for another grab or jab, and D-throw at mid+ %s once U-throw's knockback gets too high for your liking, amazing
In summery: If you want crazy combos, great speed, and lots of buttons to press, Askua has all of that for you
