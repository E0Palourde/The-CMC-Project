Gilgamesh overview! He's a somewhat slow fighter that could be considered an all-rounder, as he does okay at all ranges, but he really excels at mid-range where he's both out of harm's way and not too far to lose value on most of his moveset
The first two hits of Jab have pitiful range and damage, but is quite powerful if you hold the button down as they combo into the 3rd hit, unleashing a barrage of yellow projectiles atop the opponent, they could also work decently as a wall at the ledge, don't need to land the first 2 hits to get to the barrage (1%, 1%, 2% each continuous blasts, 9% final blast)
F-tilt has great range, but doesn't send all that far even at high %s, it also has noticeable recovery, not too good (7%)
U-tilt has comparable range to F-tilt, and can easily kill at high %s, great move (8%)
D-tilt replaces F-tilt as it has slightly better range, can kill at the ledge and sends at a nasty angle for edgeguarding too, on top of being faster, amazing (7%)
Dash attack is a sassy back-hand that doesn't do all that much, can't combo into stuff and doesn't knock back far.. (5%)
F-smash has good range and is the quickest of his smashes, but it can't kill very easily unless fully charged, and the opponent can fall out of the move if it hits near the tip.. (12% < 30%)
U-smash is quite slow but powerful, able to kill off the top very easily, also has a good hitbox and is just a great move other than the slow start (12% < 14%)
D-smash is once again slow and powerful, except it's only worth going for off-stage since it spikes, you can control where you go after you've stopped charging, you can use this to fall off the ledge with it to hopefully kill (8% < 27%)
N-Sp points and fires a straight projectile from yourself and any portals you've summoned with D-Sp, can even combo if you placed the portals far behind, but the long recovery time means it's usually not safe to do this up close (2% per shot)
D-Sp places up to 8 stationary portals behind Gil that last until he dies and fire in the direction he was facing at the time of placement when he uses N-Sp, either place them all at once when you have some time or run around like a maniac and make a minefield of them!
F-Sp is your best move by far, sends out a mid-range chain projectile that binds a struck foe wherever they were for a couple seconds, allowing you to do whatever to them, though it has a long recovery and is powerless against shields, so don't overuse it (2%)
U-Sp creates a damaging cyclone beneath you that damages enemies and combos to aerials, after the 1st use you will begin to float and can control your movements with left/right/down, freely doing aerials and specials for about 3 seconds, if you do a second U-Sp you won't float again and instead go into freefall after you rise up (1%x5 = 5% per use)
N-air is a quick hit with decent range that lasts for a little while, unfortunately doesn't cover all around you like most n-airs, can't kill or combo into stuff either, but at least it combos after U-Sp (4%)
F-air is a big slow spike with a great hitbox above Gil, does incredible shield damage too, solid move (9%)
B-air is another back-hand and it turns you around, not great unless you land with it, in that case it can possibly combo to F-Sp or D-tilt (6%)
U-air is a big slow upwards strike that can kill foes above you really easily, basically U-smash but in the air (14%)
D-air bounces up when hitting a foe, allowing it to chain into itself or another quick aerial, fun move, but careful off-stage (5%)
Grab is quick but has low range, won't work during F-Sp either.. Pummel is very quick and deals 1%, D-throw (5%) seems like a promising spike at first, but the opponent can jump quickly to recover, and on-stage they can even shield the last hit(???), not too good.. U-throw (5%) doesn't kill or combo into anything, bad .. B-throw (3%) might allow for an untrue follow-up into F-Sp, but that's about it .. F-throw (18%) deals great damage! But it has set knockback and will never kill ... Dang 
In summery, if you like pressing Forward special a lot, and using both swords and magic, Gilgamesh has all of that and is worth your time
