Silver Sonic is here, and you're all out of rings! They look like Sonic, but are slower and heavier, they can jump 3 times too, but they lack range and have no (useful) projectiles, forcing them to invade other's personal space, they excel at hitting pretty hard, and grabbing things
Jab is incredibly powerful but requires SS to be very close to use it, great move otherwise (2%, 3%, 12% = 17%)
F-tilt has slightly more range than jab, and knocks opponents further away, but deals less damage, it's decent (10%)
U-tilt only hits foes directly above SS, and is rather slow to recover, unable to combo into anything after, not very good (9%)
D-tilt is quick and has great range, can cover the ledge decently too, but despite appearances, is not disjointed.. If you're lucky, could hit with more than 1 flame (5% each)
Dash attack is best at low %s where it combos into jab, has a late hit with less knockback that allows for comboing even at high %s, pretty good (10% early, 7% late)
F-smash brings down the hammer, typical slow strong smash with short range, use it to kill stuff (16% < 24%)
U-smash is quick and powerful, and a good anti-air attack, great move (4%, 12% = 18% < 6%, 20% = 26%)
D-smash has spikes rise from the ground, ouch! A nice move with good range, though it is weaker than the other two (12% < 20%)
N-Sp fires a big freaking laser beam! Too bad it's terribly slow, deals no damage, sends the foe nowhere, and has low priority, send this move to the junkyard! (3%)
F-Sp has SS do a mock-spindash, can hold the button to delay the move (doesn't get stronger or anything by delaying), can freely turn around, or press shield or jump to cancel it, will spike foes if it hits while falling down, only deals damage at top speed, and you'll have to turn to get your hitbox back after hitting somebody (8%)
U-Sp delays a bit then launches SS up before putting them into freefall,  a simple recovery that has difficulty hitting with all it's attacks (2%x5, 5% = 15%)
D-Sp creates a barrier around SS, turning them invincible, destroying projectiles/trading with physical moves, additionally will stall in the air and allow SS to freely float left/right during it, aiding in recovery, nice move (5%)
N-air is pretty good, quick all-around hitbox, good damage if you manage to land all hits, can combo into jab if you land with it (2%x5, 5% = 15%)
F-air brings down a powerful spiking hit on the first frame only, after that it becomes a mediocre knock away hit instead, hype to land (15%, 11% late)
B-air is another slow and powerful move, but it kills horizontally, has a nice hitbox and pushes SS slightly forwards too, lame late hit after explosion (12%, 6% late)
U-air is a tiny thing that is again unreliable to land all hits, doesn't kill well or combo either, not good.. (total 11%)
D-air sends SS crashing down, good for stopping air momentum or just dealing damage below, risky off-stage (1%x9, 6% last air hit, 10% ground slam)
Grab has okay range and is average in speed, pummel deals 0% damage...? F-throw (7%) can kill, pretty nice .. U-throw (5%) can also kill, but not as well ...   D-throw strangely appears to change if you throw facing left or facing right? Right D-throw (8%) is best since it combos to jab and aerials, while left D-throw (10%) sends off-stage at higher %s ... B-throw (15%) deals great damage and can allow you to chain grab into itself repeatedly until at higher %s unless you're at the ledge, making it extremely deadly unless the opponent can DI their way out early
In summery, if you want a seemingly simple up-close fighter that has some depth to it, give Silver Sonic a chance
