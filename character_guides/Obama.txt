Obama (last name unknown) is a former president of the USA, but more importantly, he's a character in this fun game, he's an all-rounder who's fast on the ground, but has poor air mobility, especially vertically, and excels at hit & run tactics
Jab seems pretty average, deals okay damage and has short range, but with great timing, the first two hits can combo into the first two hits again, or into other moves, such as grab, U-tilt, and close N-Sp! (2%, 1%, 4% = 7%)
F-tilt is a long ranged poke, you can poke with it, go do that.. it's pretty good (4%)
U-tilt has strong knockback and hits twice, though the second hit can whiff if the first hits an airborne opponent, and it's only 7% for a big risk as it has a lot of recovery..U-smash is better at killing too, don't use this one? (7%)
D-tilt hits behind first then in front, can combo into jab/grab at lower %s if it hits behind, pretty nice for catching rolls and stuff (5%)
Dash attack stops in place before shooting you really far, decent move to stick out there once in a while, effective against a ledge too (6%)
F-Smash is big and slow, but has good knockback and can reflect projectiles just like a bat, fairly nice (6% < 10%)
U-Smash is great, has biiig range and is fast to come out, can kill decently too, if you're running you'll slide forward while doing it, this is nice but can cause the 2nd hit to whiff, so be careful (2%, 4% = 6% < 2%, 9% = 11%)
D-smash is decently fast for a smash attack, also deals more damage than the other two, but has less knockback and range, keep it in mind (10% < 32%)
For his N-Sp, he wields a gun, the bullets fly straight ahead, disappear after a bit, and knock back further than you'd expect for being so tiny, it also stuns at very close range for some reason, allowing for a follow-up, outstanding move (5%)
F-Sp tosses a slow bouncing grenade that blows up foes on contact, good for keeping pressure up, can theoretically combo into/out of anything, but works best in tandem with N-Sp or grab (5%)
U-Sp is not great, launches Obama upwards with no hitbox, going into freefall after, the range is decent but your jumps suck anyways
D-Sp is okay, prepares a rifle then fires either a stunning shot or a powerful knocking back shot depending on if you held the button down or tapped it respectively, really slow, can freely turn around until he lowers the gun, best to use against off-stage foes (4% stun, 9% powerful)
N-air is great, has good range and falling on a grounded opponent before the last hit allows you to combo into stuff, like jab and grab .. Or shorthop repeatedly to combo into itself for an infinite combo..? (2%x3, 3% = 9%)
F-air is a relatively weak knockback attack that sends downwards, but has a sourspot above that sends horizontally, it's okay (8% sweet, 5% sour)
B-air is slow with low damage, but has good knockback at higher %s, only use it then (4%)
U-air is an awkward flag wave, bad at everything, no knockback, low damage, doesn't combo into anything, a tad slow, and hard to land.. Avoid this one (4%)
D-air spikes at the explosion, but is otherwise very weak, Obama pops up into the air when he does the move, recovering quick enough to do it at almost the same spot again, allowing him to stall off-stage or in the air for quite a while, or aid in horizontal recovery, if you're running and quickly jump and D-air, you'll conserve momentum and go flying through the skies, incredible (9% explosion, 5% everywhere else)
Grab is really fast and has fine range, pummel speed is slightly above average and deals 2%, D-throw (4%) slams the opponent into the ground, they can likely tech so it's not too good, U-throw (6%) tosses into the air for a follow-up, but has too much recovery to combo, bad.. F-throw (12%) and B-throw (6%) both send off stage and B-throw can kill, very nice
In summery, if you want to do a bit of everything, and run around impaling people with a flag before riddling them with bullet holes, you too could be President one day
