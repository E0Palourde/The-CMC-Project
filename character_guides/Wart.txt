Wart overview time! Wart is a pretty simple big slow bad guy that likes doing big bad things to his opponents, he may share a few similar looking moves with Bowser, but this toad is his own boss, he excels at hitting really hard
Jab is quick but has kinda short range, pretty good damage though (6%, 7% = 13%)
F-tilt has great range and some decent knockback too, nice move (12%)
U-tilt has the worst range, requiring foes to practically be inside Wart for him to hit with it, at least it can combo to aerials sometimes (8%)
D-tilt is pretty strong and good to use against shields, the two hits can't combo to each other, and the 2nd has very slightly more range than the 1st (9% each hit)
Dash attack has alright knockback at high %s, but that's about it, nothing special (10%)
F-Smash is super slow and strong, with a nice long lasting hitbox, use this if you get a shield break (15% < 22%)
U-Smash is hard to hit just like U-tilt, it's also very weak for a smash attack, at least it's fast I guess.. (8% < 16%)
D-Smash is great, quick and buries grounded foes, spikes airborne ones, seems to have no difference when charged? (13%) 
N-Sp quickly spits out annoying bubbles that knock enemies up a bit, very nice for long range harassment and to keep the enemy on guard (3% per bubble)
F-Sp is a bit slow at first, not going very far, but at max charge you can go across the entire stage, cancelable by shielding as well as all specials, making it a fantastic movement/mix-up option if you have time to charge up, on a hit Wart will bounce high into the air, aiding recovery if he's off-stage (7% < 16%)
U-Sp is a simple flying carpet ride with no hitbox, you have superior aerial control while on the carpet, too
D-Sp only works when grounded, sends out a bunch of water geysers across the floor, allowing for an easy follow-up if the opponent happens to get caught by it, but it does poorly against shields and is easy to see coming unless you do it real close.. Hits many times, cooldown of 8 seconds, still useful on cooldown to cancel out of F-Sp instantly (0.1% per hit?)
N-air is a close range spike that has some recovery, pops Wart up a tiny bit if he hits, good move (7%)
F-air is kinda quick and has better range than N-air, can kill at high %s, also has a hitbox underneath that sends behind Wart (11%)
B-air is even faster but is rather awkward to hit with, can kill about as well as F-air despite the lower damage, it's decent (8%)
U-air like the other up-moves is difficult to hit with and not really worth that effort, being particularly weak.. (6%) 
D-air is an amazing but very risky spike with a large hitbox that will kill Wart if he misses off-stage, bounces up if it hits or lands on the ground, very nice (11%)
Grab has long range and the tongue can't be hurt, amazing! Pummel (2%) is average speed, D-throw (14%) is mostly for damage but can kill at high %s .. U-throw (13%) can likely combo to aerials at low-mid %s .. F-throw (11%) and B-throw (10%) are for throwing off-stage, and both can kill at higher %s
In summery: If you want to hit hard, shoot lots of bubbles, suddenly charge in from across the screen and grab foes with your tongue, you're weird, and Wart is for you
