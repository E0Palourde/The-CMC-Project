Somebody once told me that it's time for a Shrek overview! He's naturally a big slow heavyweight with slow and powerful short reaching moves, as well as a couple projectiles to use at a distance, but he does really want to get close, he excels at hitting hard and is suitable for intermediate players
Jab is 2 hits and forces you to do both, has passable range and damage but almost no knockback, even at high %s, not the best option usually (4%, 5% = 9%)
F-tilt has even shorter range than jab, and is overall slower, but way more knockback and can kill at high %s, not that good until then, though (10%)
U-tilt can theoretically combo to U-Sp if you hit it right and the opponent doesn't move away, but it's risky and not worth going for, just like U-tilt itself, since it's hitbox is small and it has some recovery, not too useful.. (7%)
D-tilt slides forwards a little and can combo to jab and grab at very low %s, pretty nice (8%)
Dash attack has an early hit that knocks the opponent up, and a late hit with much less knockback, you want the late one since it combos into things like jab and grab much easier until high %s (10% early, 8% late)
F-Smash is quick and smashes a toilet onto the foe, has range comparable to jab and good damage, nice knockback too, a solid move (18% < 26%)
U-Smash is also decently quick, but has short reach and isn't as strong as D-Sp, at least it deals good damage and hits twice (4%, 14% = 18% < 6%, 20% = 26%)
D-Smash is extremely fast for a smash attack, deals great damage for it's speed too, while it is the weakest of the 3 it can still kill decently, a great move despite the short range (15% < 22%)
N-Sp chucks a barrel at foes, which magically disappears after it goes a fair distance, packs a punch but travels slowly, best against recovering foes (6%)
F-Sp hurls a stone at an arc, knocking struck foes backwards into Shrek to follow-up with literally any move you want! Possibly his best move, though it's hard to land it (10%)
U-Sp spins straight up and hurts foes all around him, a pretty good recovery, shame it doesn't automatically grab the ledge though (4% initial hit, 0.7%x4, 6% last hit = 13%)
D-Sp slowly winds up and releases a toxic gas cloud that doesn't linger at all, but is lethal at high %s, being Shrek's strongest move by far, use it to edgeguard or especially after you land a stone, pops Shrek up into the air and can be used to aid in recovering horizontally (6%)
N-air spins around and can combo into stuff like jab/grab if you hit it on a grounded foe, the last hit can even combo into itself and other moves at low %s, allowing you to chain N-airs together if you're skilled enough! But ultimately it's somewhat unreliable to land all hits, still a great move though (3%x3, 5% = 14%)
F-air also can combo into stuff on a grounded foe, otherwise it's just not that good when he already has N-air (8%)
B-air is very strong and lasts a little while, a great killing/edgeguarding move, use it often (12%)
U-air has short reach but can be used at low %s to combo into things like grab and N-air, at high %s it'll kill, pretty good (11%)
D-air is a wimpy looking kick that can combo into stuff at low %s, while at higher %s it becomes a powerful spike, it's alright (7%)
Grab is average, decent reach, pummel (2%) is also average speed .. F-throw (10%) can kill at high %s .. B-throw (15%) is good for damage and positioning, but can't kill well .. U-throw (5%) and D-throw (8%) both can't really do much, U-throw has too much recovery to combo to anything, but D-throw can at least go for a mix-up after due to putting the opponent into a bad spot
In summery: If you want to play as a powerhouse that wants to be as close as possible but also isn't totally useless at a distance, Shrek is the ogre of your dreams
