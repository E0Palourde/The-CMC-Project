Smorg is here! And there, and everywhere! So many Smorgs! Smorgs are small and frail little creatures, but when working together can overcome any obstacle They've got generally slow movement but have various tools to fight at range, they have few combos and excel at keeping people out of their personal space
Their jab is pretty lame, good in a pinch to get opponents off of you I suppose, but doesn't send far nor combo into anything (2%, 6%, = 8%)
F-tilt is slightly slower than jab with a little more range, like many of it's moves, has a sweetspot at the last smorg copy that deals extra damage and knockback, sourspot is bad (4% or 7%)
U-tilt sends foes straight up, is quick and deals decent damage, fairly good (3, 8 = 11%)
D-tilt is fast and good for catching rollers, pretty nice (8%)
Dash attack is mediocre, doesn't send far even with the sweetspot, you're better using your grab if you want to run in at people (6 or 8%)
F-Smash is extremely strong and quick to start, but also risky, sometimes the last hit with the actual knockback will whiff unless at max charge, and it has a lot of recovery, use it carefully, initially hits at the main Smorg (1, 2, 2, 17 = 22% < 8, 10, 10, 24 = 52%) 
U-Smash is extremely-er strong and will kill very early, but is very slow to start, only combos into the sweetspot at the center if it hits close, not really worth the huge risk most of the time, unfortunately (4, 8% or 18% < 12, 15% or 25%)
D-smash is quick to start and has huuuuuge range on both sides, also sweetspots at the last copy, initially hits at the main Smorg, great move (2, 8 or 12% < 10, 16 or 20%)
N-Sp is a quick grab that hits all around main Smorg and can even combo into itself at low %s, an incredibly dangerous move to be hit by, can even quickly dash in and do it to combo at mid %s as well (11%)
F-Sp throws a copy either up, down, or forward depending on which direction you hold, it will then bounce along the ground until it falls off-stage, doesn't go through shields, but sticks to struck opponents and deals damage over time, can have multiple copies stuck, great for long range harassment (inital 4%, then deals 10% more over 8 seconds)
U-Sp launches Smorg upwards, has no hitbox and puts you into Helpless state after, bad but your only option sometimes
D-Sp transforms Smorg into a towering mass of smorgs, deals minor damage by walking and can bite an enemy once, takes way too long to do anything, has a sweetspot at the center, can't shield or cancel it, loses it if you take any knockback, only use this if you get a shield break, otherwise don't bother (3% walking, 10% or 30% for bite)
N-air is a quick hit by main Smorg, decent move for getting foes away from you, and can even combo into grab or something if you hit a grounded foe at lower %s (8%)
All of Smorg's other aerials have sweetspots at the last copy
F-air is incredible, has huge range, hits everywhere in front of Smorg, use liberally to deter approaches and to edgeguard (7 or 10%)
B-air is similar to F-air, but slower and stronger with an even bigger hitbox that can hit above Smorg, fantastic move (8 or 12%)
U-air is a tall hitbox that can kill if the sweetspot at the top hits, though it could be difficult since it's so high up there, has an additional sweetspot at the main Smorg, very nice move (10% at main smorg or 4% at copies or 12% at top copy)
D-air is like the rest of Smorg's air moves, amazing and gigantic, 1st hit is same on both sides of Smorg, sweetspot spikes (5, 5 or 11%)
Grab is long ranged, really nice, and the pummel is 3 quick hits doing 1% each, the grabs themselves are lackluster, U-throw is 5%, won't kill usually, and doesn't combo, D-throw is similarly bad, but at least deals 7%, F-throw is pretty good at higher %s, sends off-stage (9%), B-throw deals 13% and also sends off-stage and up
In summery, if you want to wall people out with powerful long ranged aerials and throw an endless supply of copies of yourself, Smorg is your swarm to command
