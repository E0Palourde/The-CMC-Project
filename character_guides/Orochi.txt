Orochi overview time! He's a tall and imposing figure with somewhat slow movement, and can fight at mid-to-close range well, he also passively heals 1% every 3 seconds, but he's not without weakness, having just average weight and being tall means he can get comboed easily and die quickly, he excels at hitting hard and edgeguarding
Jab can cancel to F-tilt and U-tilt only on a successful hit, but at high %s it won't combo to them anymore, it's a nice move despite the rather short range (5%)
F-tilt has only slightly more range than jab, but a tall hitbox, it's also a projectile, has quick startup and recovery, along with good knockback, very nice (8%)
U-tilt has only slightly more range than F-tilt, so it's decent in that department, but it has some noticeable recovery that prevents it from following up easily, at least it has good knockback at high %s (6%)
D-tilt has 2 hits, the first hit can combo to itself, then you can cancel to the 2nd to finish said combo, or you can combo to jab and it's follow-ups instead for even more damage, at mid-high %s the jab follow-ups won't work and it'd be best to combo to F-tilt or grab instead, a very nice move all-around (4%, 6% = 10%)
Dash attack is really strong but has some recovery like U-tilt, best to use as a punish (7%)
F-Smash is also really strong, and is a projectile like F-tilt, but has low range comparable to jab, best for a big punish (11% < 18%)
U-Smash is great, a bit slow but has massive vertical range and goes further out the more you charge, look for opportunities to use it (13% < 20%)
D-Smash has great horizontal range and is decently quick, though it won't be killing as early as the other smashes, still good though (11% < 18%)
N-Sp takes a bit to start up, but it will absorb an enemy projectile and make Orochi invincible for a bit as he fires a large one back at the opponent, regardless of how strong the foe's projectile was, it will always do the same damage, also slows your fall in the air just like the rest of his specials (25%)
F-Sp is great, has slow startup but sends out a lot of suddenly appearing projectiles in a straight path to carry your opponent with them, allowing for you to follow-up into whatever you like, including aerials, grabs, tilts, etc. it'll stop after a long distance or if the opponent shields one of them (2% per hit, 27 max projectiles)
U-Sp is very strong and has a decent hitbox to cover Orochi's head, it's also a passable recovery despite putting you into freefall, I suggest learning how to B-Reverse to get the most out of it (10%)
D-Sp has long startup and is active for a whopping 4 seconds in which it pulls the opponent horizontally towards Orochi, he gains super armor during this and they can't shield it, if they touch him, he will grab and perform a devastatingly powerful move that kills very easily off the top, but it doesn't pull if Orochi is facing the wrong way, meaning if they jump over you're vulnerable for those 4 seconds, be very careful with this attack (35%) 
N-air can combo to tilts on the ground at lower %s, at high %s it's generally not worth going for since the hitbox is small and it doesn't lead to anything in the air (5%)
F-air has a really good hitbox and is active for a little while, though it also doesn't lead to anything really, except for tilts and D-smash at near 0%, nice move (7%)
B-air has a similarly small hitbox to N-air, and it doesn't combo on the ground as well aside from D-smash, but in the air it sends downwards and is very dangerous to be hit by at high %s up there, nice (6%)
U-air is kinda like a less risky version of U-Sp, decent for juggling foes but doesn't really combo to anything (9%)
D-air combos to D-smash on the ground at low %s, otherwise it's best in the air and is kinda an easier to hit but less powerful B-air (7%)
Grab is a tad slow, especially the running version, pummel (3%) is average speed, F-throw (11%) and B-throw (12%) are for killing horizontally with F-throw being a tad better at it .. U-throw is mostly for positioning as it doesn't lead to anything nor kill until quite high %s .. D-throw (15%) is for damage and it spikes off-stage too
In summery: If you want a mostly simple and powerful close-up brawler, you can't go wrong with Orochi
