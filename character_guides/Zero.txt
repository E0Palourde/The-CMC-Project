Zero (regular Zero) overview time! He's an average speed swordfighter specializing in mid-range combat, with plenty of options to keep within that range
Jab has 3 hits to it, isn't too slow, and has fairly good reach, nice (2%, 2%, 2%x3 = 10%)
F-tilt has slightly more range and knockback than jab, but some more recovery, it's decent (9%)
U-tilt has great range and can chain into itself, but not to aerials that well due to the recovery, it's okay (5%)
D-tilt is a tad slow and shorter ranged, but it can at least combo to stuff like jab and aerials at mid-high %s (8%)
Dash attack is decently powerful at high %s, with good range too, not the best before then though (8%)
F-Smash has huge reach but isn't particularly strong, it also has some recovery as well like the rest of his smashes (15% < 22%)
U-Smash is amazing, has massive vertical reach and damage, especially when charged, use it often against aerial foes (16% < 31%!)
D-Smash for some reason sends foes vertically if Zero is facing to the left, and more horizontally if facing to the right, regardless of where the attack hits the opponent, it's a nice move for catching rollers (15% < 22%) 
N-Sp fires a straight shot that quickly goes away, it's decent to keep some foes at bay I guess, and is your longest reaching attack (8%) 
N-Sp in the air is entirely different, Zero slowly spins around with his sword out, it's a fantastic hitbox, but it has a lot of recovery after, careful when using it off-stage (1%x6? 3% last hit = 9% .. 5% landing on ground hit)
F-Sp is just a dash that can be used to aid in recovery and movement, can only be used once in the air and can cancel to all normals and specials, but not smashes
U-Sp is very powerful with good range, similar to U-Smash but airborne, a great finishing move and recovery, fantastic (2%x6, 6% last hit = 18%)
D-Sp goes into a stance where you can do 3 moves depending on holding up, forward, or down.. Up is just a quick slash that also has a hitbox inside Zero, nothing special about it (8%) .. Forward is fantastic, decently fast with huge range and can cancel to other specials at any of it's 5 hits, use N-Sp if you hit from far away, or U-Sp if you hit up close (2%x4, 3% last hit = 11%) .. Down is a big slow strike that breaks shields, also great (20%)
N-air is quick with good range and knockback, at low %s can combo to grounded moves such as jab and grab (7%)
F-air is fast to start, hits 4 times, and has noticeable recovery after, it's good damage against shields but is a bit risky (2%x3, 4% last hit = 10%)
B-air is somewhat slow overall and has a similar hitbox to f-air, but it has more knockback, making it a decent killing tool (8%)
U-air has really nice speed and range, but is a bit weak in terms of knockback and can struggle to kill vertically, also has some recovery too (8%)
D-air is interesting, sends Zero straight down and will spike at the tip of the blade, but starting at 55% damage it'll freeze foes for a bit instead of spiking properly, meaning it's then better to hit with the non-spiking hitbox further up the blade (12%)
Grab has short range and average speed, pummel (2%) is pretty fast .. F-throw (10%) and B-throw (10%) are decent at killing at the ledge, but F-throw is a bit better at that .. D-throw (9%) just slams the opponent on the ground .. U-throw (10%) can be followed-up with an aerial sometimes, but can't seem to actually true combo into anything
In summery: If you like swords, Zero has that, so go play him
