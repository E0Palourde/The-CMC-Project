Azrael is that guy with the scythe, he's very slow and weird overall, but has traps and perilous situations he can get the opponent into if given enough time
He obviously excels at mid-range combat and pressuring foes
Jab is 3 hits from his scythe, starts really quick but has some recovery, 1st hit has worse range than the other two, overall a decent move (2%, 3%, 4% = 9%)
F-tilt is a tad slow but has fine range and knockback, also deals great damage to shields, very nice move (9%)
U-tilt is quick and covers a good area above and in front, can combo into aerials and itself at low %s sometimes, another great move (8%)
D-tilt is also quick, combos into itself and other moves such as U-tilt, fantastic (6%)
Dash attack has fine range and good damage, but some recovery, you can't follow-up after it really, it's okay if you see an opening for it (12%)
F-smash is just a really strong swing, but lacks in horizontal range, be careful with it (16% < 24%)
U-smash has a huge upwards hitbox and can kill easily, but it's recovery has you just holding out your scythe like a fool for almost a full second, make sure you can hit your mark (14% < 22%)
D-smash is faster and weaker than F-smash, it also has more horizontal range but less vertical, overall it's a pretty great move (14% < 21%)
N-Sp weakly attacks with an aura around him before spawning an extremely slow moving ghost that chases the opponent but eventually pops on it's own, you can have up to 2 ghosts at once, they can be used for a variety of things like threatening recovering foes, or comboing, 'sandwiching' the foe between you and ghost(s), or just area denial (7% aura, 7% ghost) 
F-Sp weakly swings forward before placing a rift a set distance forwards, it bounces foes off of it, allowing you to hit them into it, then they're launched back to you to hit them again, can repeatedly combo into f-tilt and u-tilt for example, after about 5 seconds the rift will zap foes vertical to it, dealing high knockback, but it's rare to land this (4% scythe, 1% rift bounce, 17% zap)
U-Sp on the ground makes Az turn invisible and invincible for a split second before powerfully slashing, it deals decent shield damage too, in the air if you tap special Az will become invincible while slashing wildly 5 times, hold special instead to slash 8 times and go higher up (16% ground, 14% tap, 18% hold)
D-Sp wimpily hits with the scythe, if successful will cause a little reaper dude to hover over the opponent's head for ~3 seconds, then it'll strike for pathetic knockback but good damage, if you're able to hit D-Sp twice in a row before the first reaper attacks, two reapers attack instantly, doubling the damage! While the reaper is great for scaring foes, the wimpy hit is awful, being short ranged with a lot of recovery, use it sparingly.. (2% wimp, 14% reaper)
N-air hits all around Az, but it's quite weak and a bit slow to start for a n-air, at least it can combo into jab and U-Sp sometimes (6%)
F-air is quick and has good range, very nice (7% early, 4% late)
B-air is a bit slow but has a generous hitbox and can kill, good move (12%)
U-air is like a weaker quicker U-smash, in the air, so it's great (10%)
D-air can be a great and powerful spike at the center of the blade, or it can be a silly weak hit, good for the wide range it covers (12% center, 7% edges, 5% body)
Grab has longer reach than it looks, pummel deals 1.5%? All his throws cannot really kill or combo, and are mostly useful for positioning.. D-throw (5%) sends the opponent up and forward a bit .. U-throw (6%) sends more up and also a bit behind .. B-throw (5%) sends back and up a bit.. And F-throw (7%) barely sends forwards even at high %s..
In summery: If you want to be that one wacky guy that relies on traps and strategy,  or you just like scythes for some reason, maybe you should give Azrael a try
