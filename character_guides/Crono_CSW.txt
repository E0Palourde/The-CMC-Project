Crono (CSW) overview time! He feels unique compared with most other fighters, and is an average speed swordsman with weird multi-hit attacks and movement options, he excels at punishing opponent's mistakes as well as pressuring them
Jab can be done up to 3 times and causes Crono to wildly spin forwards, back, then forwards again, a pretty good move with nice range, won't combo to the last hit if you hit with the tip of the first though, but you can stop any time and go for a grab or something instead (2%, 4%, 6% = 12%)
F-tilt also has good range and is done up to 3 times, but less than jab, and while it does do good damage if all hits land, they don't true combo into each other, allowing the opponent to just react and shield, not worth it if they know that.. (5%, 5%, 7% = 17%)
U-tilt meanwhile is great, almost same range as F-tilt, done up to 3 times, same damage, but all the hits combo into each other, and it can further combo to n-air or at least allow for an aerial follow-up, the 3rd hit won't land after the 2nd at high %s though (5%, 5%, 7% = 17%)
D-tilt can be done twice, both hits combo and it deals fine damage and knockback, a pretty decent move to have, first hit has more knockback against aerial foes and won't combo then (5%, 7% = 12%)
Dash attack deals pathetic damage and almost no knockback, but it has good range and  shreds through shields, an interesting move for sure (1%x8? = 8%)
F-smash has amazing range and good killpower, but long startup and recovery, use it to punish similarly long recovery moves from your opponent, or to catch landings, decent move (10% < 17%)
U-Smash is relatively quick but short ranged initially, leaps up into the air but is stuck in recovery almost the entire way down, an amazing move with great damage and killpower, can be further improved with a technique I call a "hop-smash", if you simply jump and land, or do any aerial action and recover before you hit the ground, you can then do an U-smash with full aerial control during it, you can even use an U-smash into another U-smash for this! If you hold forward as you land you can store the hop-smash as long as you want until you release forward or do any other action (22% < 37%) 
D-smash is 2 hits and you're forced to do both, they don't true combo which greatly limits this move's uses, the 1st hit also has a late hitbox that knocks foes out of the way of the 2nd anyways, but the 2nd hit is quite strong if you somehow manage to land it, such as after a shield break (5%, 16% < 11%, 23%)
N-Sp fires a short range projectile that can hit twice and combo into stuff at low %s, has 3 levels of charge but no indication of when it levels up.. Level 1 hurts shields a lot and is generally the best, but is shortest range, use it often (4%x2 = 8%) .. Level 2 is stronger and goes further, but doesn't do good vs shields (6%, 5% = 11%) .. Level 3 can kill, goes much further, but is slowest to fire and also doesn't do good against shields (7%x2 = 14%)
F-Sp summons Robo, grabbing Crono and spinning around at turbo speed before launching him forwards, completely demolishes shields with a gigantic hitbox, but is extremely slow to start too, an interesting move, stalls in the air and launches Crono down-forwards instead (10% spinning, 5% launch = 15%)
U-Sp summons Ayla and throws Crono up, slow to start but a good recovery anyways, can kill too, but is hard to hit with (10%)
D-Sp slowly places a lightning blade, can tap D-Sp again to strike it with lightning, for some reason only has a up above the blade in the air, greatly hampering it's usefulness unless the opponent just loves to jump around, has long recovery when making lightning strike too... (10%)
N-air is like jab but airborne, really good especially for stalling and mixing up your landing, falling N-air can combo to ground moves too, such as jab and U-tilt (2%, 4%, 6% = 12%)
F-air is a forced two hit swing with great hitboxes, the 2nd hit can spike at the end beneath Crono, outstanding (7%, 10%, 12% spike)
B-air has a similar great hitbox to the first hit of F-air, but it spikes at the start, and the later hitboxes can kill horizontally, another amazing move (8% spike, 6% late)
U-air has another good hitbox and you can control where it goes too, if you press the button again Crono will launch down at high speed, spiking the opponent and SDing if done off-stage, if you reach the ground at any point he'll do a slam move that can kill decently well (0.5% per hit, 1% per hit while falling, 5% slam)
D-air stalls then moves Crono at light speed to slash through his foe and send them upwards, can control it a little by holding left/right after starting, a weird but nice move to have (10%)
Grab has extremely short range and lasts for a little while, pummel (3%) is a tad slow .. B-throw (8%) is good for positioning, and for some reason launches more horizontally if facing right, and vertically if facing left? .. U-throw (10%) summons Frog and can kill at high %s and leads very nicely into D-Sp or D-air .. D-throw (10%) summons Luca and can occasionally combo to N-air 1, and is decent for non-true aerial follow-ups, but that's about it .. F-throw (14%) summons Marle and is good for damage and non-true aerial follow-ups, it can start freezing opponents at or above 66%, making it even more dangerous for them
In summery: If you want a uniquely complex multi-hitting swordfighter with some weird stuff mixed in, give Crono (CSW) a chance
