Kim Kaphwan overview time! Kim is a very fast fighter (nearly able to keep up with the likes of Sonic!) with simple and effective close-range options, he can struggle at long range and when recovering though, but he excels at hit & run and pressuring his opponents
All of his normals unless otherwise stated can special cancel to F-Sp and U-Sp, allowing for easy combos
Jab has 3 button presses and has decent range, the last hit can't special cancel, first 2 hits can combo into a grab or D-tilt, very nice (2%, 2%, 4% = 8%)
F-tilt is very slow for a tilt but instantly breaks full shields if both hits land, making it very dangerous if you suddenly throw it out against a defensive foe, otherwise it's not really worth going for at lower %s (4%, 6% = 10%)
U-tilt is very quick to start and has good knockback at high %s, but is slightly worse range than jab, you can improve the range dramatically by dashing just before starting the move, only the 1st hit can special cancel (4%, 6% = 10%)
D-tilt is really good, super fast and can combo to itself and several other moves including grab and U-Sp, use it often when up close, also you can dash before starting it to greatly increase it's effective range like U-tilt! (2%)
Dash attack is unique, slides in for a bit before delivering a powerful but kinda slow kick, can be unreliable to combo all 5 hits, especially if you hit too far or too close, or at a ledge .. Too risky most of the time (1%, 2%, 2%, 3%, 6% = 14%)
F-Smash is slow and powerful with decent range, dealing good damage and knockback, nice to use on occasion (19% < 23%)
U-Smash is even slower and stronger than F-Smash, has an awkward hitbox just below Kim's actual leg (17% < 20%)
D-Smash is quick and the only smash that can be special canceled, but it's the weakest and still has some recovery after, it's okay at low %s (14% < 18%)
N-Sp only works on the ground, it enters a special stance where your only options are to leave the stance by pressing special again, or doing 1 of 4 unique attacks that all cannot special cancel .. Pressing attack or grab will do a quick kick that can't kill or combo to anything, nearly useless (4%) .. Up does a move similar to F-tilt that also breaks full shields, decent (11%) ,, Forward / back does a long range kick similar to F-smash but less damage, at least it has more knockback than uncharged F-Smash (9%) .. Down does a slow stomp that buries grounded foes and spikes airborne ones, it's decent .. Can slide forward into any of these moves by inputting N-Sp just after dashing
F-Sp lunges forwards with a 3 hitting kick, ground version travels varying distance based on your momentum, furthest right after a dash, same damage in the air and on the ground, but the last air hit has slightly more knockback, a very nice combo finisher, especially on the ground (2%, 2%, 6% = 10%)
U-Sp is a powerful 2 hit attack that goes decently high up and puts Kim into freefall, great for killing vertically, but rarely the 2nd hit can whiff, which is awful for you (3%, 9% = 12%)
D-Sp slowly jumps up and dives down with a series of kicks, deals good shield damage, but most importantly can be instantly canceled from landing any aerial normal attack regardless of if you're in range for the D-Sp or not, making it really nice to do for some extra damage whenever you need it (8% raw, 6% aerial cancel)
N-air is a fast punch with a lot of hitstun, can combo to several moves on the ground, or to any special in the air, pretty great despite the short range (3%)
F-air is the only aerial that can't special cancel, does a quick short range spiking hit with some recovery, obviously great to use off-stage (8%)
B-air is quick to start and has really nice range, but has some recovery, good for edgeguarding or stopping approaches, also turns Kim around at the end of it (6%)
U-air  is really weak, but it lasts a long time and can combo to other moves well, especially if it lands on the ground, surprisingly useful (4%)
D-air has good horizontal range and is the most damaging aerial, though it struggles to kill, pretty nice still (9%)
Grab is rather short ranged with some recovery, not good but at least Kim is really fast to make it easier, Pummel (3%) is average speed .. F-throw (9%) is good for positioning, but can't kill until very high %s.. B-throw (6%) is pretty similar to F-throw but with less damage .. 
U-throw (7%) can be followed up with aerials at low-mid %s, can maybe kill at very high %s, but you don't need it for that .. D-throw (7%) is a very powerful spike off-stage, on-stage it's shockingly strong if the opponent can't tech it, they likely won't since it's a very fast throw and you can do it any time, likely your strongest killing move!
In summery: If you want to be an ultra fast close-up fighter with some satisfyingly simple combos, look no further than Kim Kaphwan
