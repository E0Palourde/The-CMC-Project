Ichigo overview time! He's a swordsman with great speed and range, but those come at a cost, he really struggles to kill and his recovery isn't the best, he excels at hit & run tactics
Jab is a quick decently ranged 3 hit series, the 2nd hit has the shortest range and thus can whiff even if you hit with the 1st, has passable knockback and is pretty good overall (2%, 2%, 4% = 8%)
F-tilt has a little more range than jab 1, but is slightly slower, has okay knockback I suppose (5%)
U-tilt is fast and covers Ichigo from all sides but down, a very nice move to have despite it's low damage and difficulty to combo stuff after (4%)
D-tilt has amazing range and nice damage, but can't hit right in front of Ichigo, it can possibly combo to other stuff after, including F-tilt and U-tilt, an outstanding poking move (7%)
Dash attack is kinda like D-tilt, but it knocks the opponent horizontally and can help kill at high %s, another great move (7%)
F-Smash is kinda fast, and does two hits, the 2nd hit is automatic if you land the first one, it doesn't have great kill potential though due to the angle it sends the opponent, it's alright (5%, 9% = 14% < 5%, 17% = 22%)
U-Smash is pretty good, similar to U-tilt, but it's behind hitbox can spike, generally isn't great at killing though, again due to the weird angles it can send the opponent in sometimes (9% < 16% in front, 7% < 14% above, 12% < 20% behind)
D-Smash can actually kill and lasts for a long while, does good damage too with a great hitbox! But it's kinda slow to start and leaves you vulnerable after, use it wisely (12% < 20%) 
N-Sp sends out a tall projectile, you can charge it to make it slower and deal more damage, but it's not worth charging, stick with harassing with the uncharged version, in the air it has to be uncharged and it knocks away horizontally instead of vertically, making it much better (5% < 10%)
F-Sp launches Ichigo straight forward while cutting through foes, you can charge it to dramatically increase the distance, will stall in the air and allow you to recover, but puts you in freefall after, nice (5% < 15%)
U-Sp on the ground just helicopters in place, not really worth going for since you already have U-tilt and such to keep your head safe, in the air though it makes you fly up a good distance, but it doesn't snap to the ledge, you have to be very careful when you use this move to recover.. (9 hits 10% ground, 12 hits 14% air)
N-air is fantastic, quick all-around hitbox that can knock back pretty far at high %s, while at low %s it can combo into various moves on the ground, use this often (6%)
F-air makes Ichigo dash forwards before suddenly attacking, the dash can be used to slide along the ground or aid in recovery, a great movement tool and a decent attack as well that can combo into other stuff, nice move (5%)
B-air first hits behind then both behind and in front of Ichigo, despite this great hitbox this move doesn't do much, having mediocre knockback and low damage, it also turns Ichigo around (5%)
U-air is similar to U-tilt, but in the air, good at juggling foes and comboing into grounded stuff at low %s (4%)
D-air is a fast fairly powerful spike that can kill off-stage nicely, while on the ground it can combo into stuff, usually jab, amazing move (4%)
Grab is average, as is Pummel (2%), D-throw (1%, 6%) doesn't amount to much, the opponent can tech away before the 6% hit even comes out! U-throw (4%) can combo at low %s, usually to jab, while at mid-high %s it can combo to aerials instead, pretty nice .. B-throw (10%) can also combo at low-mid %s, but isn't very useful after that .. F-throw (10%) is just for positioning until high %s where it finally becomes decent at knocking the opponent off-stage
D-Sp charges up your meter (it also fills when you deal damage), allowing you to press it again when it's full to transform into Bankai Ichigo, but you'll have to check out his separate overview for info about that, as this one is already long enough as it is!
In summery: If you want to go really fast and have to stab people plenty of times before they finally go down, Ichigo could be for you
