Hope you're fired up for an Ikki overview! Ikki is a speedy average weight fighter with decent range that excels at hit & run, and punishing opponent's mistakes, suitable for intermediate and advanced players
His jab has 3 hits, does good damage and can combo into N-Sp at mid %s, very good (4%x3 = 12%)
F-tilt has pretty good range and is nice to throw out when you want to poke at a distance, great move (7%)
D-tilt is shorter range than F-tilt and is similar to the last hit of jab, it recovers faster and does slightly more damage than F-tilt, too (9%)
U-tilt requires the opponent to be right next to you, but can combo into itself and/or aerials for nice damage (7%)
Dash attack is amazing and your main punish tool, launches Ikki forward really far, goes right past shields, but on a hit you'll bounce into the air away from the opponent, can hold forward to instead bounce towards your foe and allow for a follow-up air attack or N-Sp combo (7%)
F-smash is relatively quick, has barely more range than F-tilt, and is pretty powerful too, great move (14% < 22%)
U-smash is similar to F-smash but it has worse damage and hits straight up, another good move (12% < 20%)
D-smash is fast and hits all around Ikki, nice for catching rolls probably (13% < 20%)
N-Sp has Ikki throw three quick projectiles that if they hit the opponent, stick to them, then explode shortly after in succession, allowing you to follow up with whatever you want, but if you miss even a single projectile, your N-Sp will go on cooldown for 5 seconds, use it when you see an opening for it, will not go on cooldown if all 3 hit a shield, also does almost no shield damage and doesn't stick either, the opponent can shield between when the projectiles initially hit and when they start exploding, but if they try that, you can run up and use F-Sp to destroy their shield for an even more deadly combo! (1% per projectile, 1% per explosion = 6%)
F-Sp is very risky, but has huge reward potential, Ikki unleashes a super-duper dashing punch straight through the opponent! It can instantly break shields, and will stun on a hit that doesn't end with Ikki right next to the opponent, it'll stun much longer if you hit it perfectly near the center of the attack's range, it can even spike an airborne fighter and due to the stunning they likely won't get back, however the move has massive recovery time, and if initiated while airborne sends you into a freefall ..Despite these risks, it's an amazing move, won't stun again for a couple seconds after stunning (15% stun, 6% end close)
U-Sp creates powerful flame wings around Ikki that he flies up with, this can kill and is generally a pretty good recovery too (8%)
D-Sp summons 10 fireballs to encircle Ikki, but is then on cooldown for 10 seconds, similar to N-Sp you can combo these fireballs into each other and your other attacks, they last until destroyed by the opponent's attacks or hitting the opponent directly, and can even stack with themselves as much as you want if you can keep them around as Ikki becomes a walking inferno, fantastic move, use whenever you have the time (1%x10 = 10%)
N-air hits all around Ikki, quick and good as a combo starter against grounded opponents at low-mid%s, same with F-air and B-air (8%)
F-air is a decent combo finisher that sends the opponent away, doesn't spike despite it's looks (8%)
B-air is an aerial F-tilt, great startup and range but with some recovery, it also turns you around (7%)
U-air is a slightly higher knockback U-tilt that can be decent for juggling and killing vertically (7%)
D-air is risky, launches Ikki downwards, letting him slide a short distance along the ground if he lands, can spike at the beginning and combos off of N-Sp for a deadly off-stage finisher (11%)
Grab has short range but is forgiven since Ikki is fast, pummel (2%) is average speed, F-throw (13%) is mostly for positioning and damage .. B-throw (12%) can kill at high %s easier than the rest .. U-throw (10%) can kill vertically rather well .. D-throw (10%) can combo to aerials at mid %s, but it's not too easy to do so
In summery, if you like taking risks and being creative with unique specials, as well as having quick attacks and simple combos to pester the opponent with otherwise, Ikki's the guy you've been looking for
