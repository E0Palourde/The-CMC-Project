#BASIC:
Mokou takes self damage when using physical attacks. Mokou's projectiles will disappear if she's in a hurt state or dies.

#METERS:
Life Meter: Increases when taking damage. Zero Resets when dead. Caps at 200%.

Spell Meter: 
Decreases when using projectile attacks or when flying. Slowly recovers overtime, but recovers faster when dealing physical damage. If the Spell Meter is too low, Mokou will start flashing red and she'll lose access to her projectile normals and flight. 

#SPECIALS:
Neutral B: Resurrection
If successful, heals Mokou depending on how high the Life Meter was. Deals more damage the higher Mokou's percent is. Devastating move in the right hands, but note that the hitbox is deceptively small. Also non-existent knockback growth. Death on whiff.

Side B: Self Destruction Fire Talon
3-Hit Rekka attack. Keep pressing B for other inputs. Use left or right to switch directions mid-rekka. The 3rd hit becomes stronger the longer you delay it.

Up B: Firebird
Explosive jump. Launches nearby foes. If special button was held, you'll start flying, which rapidly drains the Spell Meter. Can cancel flight into anything.

Down B: Mt.Fuji Volcano
Flaming dive kick. On hit on a grounded opponent, Mokou creates a giant fire pillar, trapping the victim. On an airborne opponent, Mokou will continue dragging them down until she lands or reaches the blastzone. On block, Mokou will backflip away from the opponent. On whiff, you're probably dead.

A+B: Spontaneous Human Combustion
A buff with the following effects.
+Boosts Mokou's damage output depending on how high the Life Meter was before use. 
+All attacks gain armor breaking abilities. 
+Neutral B becomes a kill move.
-Neutral B loses its healing ability.
-Life Meter stops increasing.
-Mokou takes passive damage.

Final Smash: Phoenix Rebirth
Based on her Last Word. Become a Touhou Boss! Press B to shoot even more bullets.
