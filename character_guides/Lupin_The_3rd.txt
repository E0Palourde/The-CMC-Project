Lupin Lupin Lupin, aka Lupin the 3rd, is a rather awkward heavy-hitter, his moves are generally risky but pack a big punch if they land, and while he has some projectiles when at a distance, he excels at close combat
Jab is a quick medium range punch with good knockback, but has some recovery after, very good move, can even kill at higher %s (9%)
F-tilt is very similar to jab, but with a worse hitbox and 1% more damage, stick to jab unless you're confident you're close enough to hit this I guess (10%)
U-tilt has a psychic hitbox that reaches even further than jab, it recovers faster too, though it doesn't have as much knockback as jab, it's still a great move you should use often (9%)
D-tilt reaches as far as jab and can actually combo into things at low-mid %s, such as jab, grab, or possibly an aerial, but it has weak knockback and damage, it's decent (7%)
Dash attack can combo into stuff like grab at low %s, otherwise it's not all that great compared to just going for the grab anyways (9%)
F-Smash is a big wind-up punch, has the same range as jab, deals incredibly high knockback but is very risky to just throw out, save it for a big punish such as if you break their shield (16% < 24%)
U-Smash is like U-tilt, but with muuuuch more recovery, not worth it in most cases, just use U-tilt or something instead (13% < 18%)
D-Smash has some startup, but deals great damage and knockback with no recovery at all, does good vs shields too, an amazing move (19% < 26%)
For his N-Sp, he wields a gun, the bullets reach really far, are quick, and have good knockback even at lower %s, making recovery from off-stage very difficult sometimes.. only flaw is that they deal (2%) .. If done in the air, will more slowly shoot a single bullet downwards that pops the opponent up, has an additional close range hit too, if you hit with both you can sometimes combo into things, decent to have (5% close, 1% bullet)
F-Sp lobs some dynamite really far that slowly goes downwards, it pairs well with your gun (4%)
U-Sp swings up on a rope, catching struck opponents and releasing both of you at the same time, may the fastest aerial win... It's a nice and unique recovery.. Against a shielding opponent, won't catch them, but will seemingly force them to jump? (1%)
D-Sp looks just like your taunt, but will counter-attack anyone that tries to hurt you, loses to multi-hit moves and projectiles though (20%)
N-air is very fast and has a huge hitbox, use it to wall out opponents, and to chain into itself and other moves, nice move (5%)
F-air and B-air are the same, except B-air turns you around, decent moves to knock people away with, but they have trouble killing (9%)
U-air is there, weak but fast with a small hitbox, can juggle decently I guess, but isn't great (6%)
D-air is really nice, sends Lupin down and bounces off the opponent if it hits, allowing you to do more D-airs or whatever you want really (8%)
Grab has good range and is very threatening since all his throws are powerful, pummel is average speed and deals 2%, D-throw (12%) knocks the opponent to the floor, decent move ...  B-throw (15%) knocks opponents away even at low %s, but won't kill or combo really .. F-throw (18%) does kill at higher %s, very nice ... U-throw (18%) hardly sends the opponent anywhere, but it can usually combo into aerials after it, maybe other stuff at low %s, either way it's your best throw, use it often
In summery, if you want to be an annoyingly strong little guy with a gun, give Lupin a shot
