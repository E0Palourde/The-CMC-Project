Kung Fu Girl overview time! KFG is faster and more combo based than her male counterpart, with a slightly worse recovery and lighter weight, she excels at close range combat, but has options at mid range as well, I'll again tell how much damage moves do, and add up to the total this time
Her jab and all tilts have 3 attacks each, every one of these 1st and 2nd attacks can cancel into a follow-up tilt (So for example, if you hit with jab 1, you can hold forward and do F-tilt 2, then hold up and do U-tilt 3), or a smash attack, or a special, the 3rd hit can only cancel to specials, all of them aside from the 3rd hit can combo into all smashes and, every 1st 2nd and 3rd hit combo into one of or both F-Sp and U-Sp
Jab is a series of quick punches, they're short ranged and the 2nd hit can whiff sometimes, not really worth going for unless you want your opponent off of you maybe (3%, 4%, 5% = 12%)
F-tilt starts with a long range kick, though the 2nd hit can again whiff if you're too far away, as well as smash and special cancels, it's generally a great poking move, best to cancel the 2nd hit into F-Sp (2, 3, 3 = 8)
U-tilt is your best tilt, deals the most damage and almost always combos to U-smash and U-sp, even the last hit can still combo at mid-high %s if you jump after them, use this often when you're close! (4, 5, 6 = 15)
D-tilt is not great, you have to be kinda close to do it, and at that point you can just U-tilt, deals the least damage and knockback of the tilts, at least it's fast (2, 2, 3 = 7)
Dash attack has an oddly small hitbox above the leg, it can't really combo into stuff, and kills later than your grabs, so just grab them or U-tilt or something instead.. (12%)
All her smash attacks are 2 part attacks, if you cancel jab/tilt 1 into a smash attack, you'll get both hits of the smash, cancel jab/tilt 2, you'll get the 2nd part, and you can't cancel jab/tilt 3 into smashes, only specials
F-smash: best horizontal range of the smashes, but it's not saying too much, usually can't combo into the 2nd hit if the 1st is charged up, overall outshined by U-smash (10, 11 = 21% < 16, 16 = 32%)
D-smash: low knockback allows for comboing into specials easier, can hit on both sides allowing for a roll punish, otherwise lackluster (4, 10 = 14% < 10, 14 = 24%)
U-smash: very high damage, speed, and the 2nd hit is a huge anti-air, absolutely incredible, 1st hit can combo to U-Sp for extra damage (16, 10 = 26% < 23, 17 = 40!%) 
N-Sp: summons a Kung Fu Ghost! Long recovery time and short range of the ghost limits usefulness, decent to do against an off-stage foe I guess, goes down in the air (5%)
F-Sp: does a 3 hit series just like her tilts, the 2nd hit can whiff occasionally, making it hard to true combo sometimes, obviously use this as a combo finisher, good for recovery too, and can start it again if you hit your opponent (3, 4, 10 = 17%)
U-Sp: another 3 hit series, short range but is a good spike on the last hit, can start it again if you hit your opponent, use this after U-tilt/U-smash, or whenever you're close really (7, 5, 5 = 17%)
D-Sp: a counter, this one stuns and allows for a follow-up on the ground, or throws them down if in the air, have to be right in front of your opponent for it to work (10%)
Her N-air and B-air have late hitboxes that deal 5% each, these allow for combos even at very high %s
N-air: great move, fast, hits on both sides, and allows for a combo at most %s, can combo into pretty much anything on the ground as well as U-Sp (12%)
F-air: quick and powerful, deals good damage, but doesn't combo into things really (13%)
B-air: Also quick, but less powerful, lasts longer though, and can combo easily with the late hit, nice (11%)
D-air: can spike, as well as combo into things if hit on the ground, decent but kinda slow and hard to land (12%)
U-air: can kill off the top decently well, along with combo into other moves if you land on the ground quickly after hitting it, pretty good (10%)
Her grab and 2% pummel are fairly average, F-throw is for killing at the ledge (10%), same as B-throw (13%), U-throw can kill off the top at very high %'s, shouldn't be used otherwise (13%)
Her down throw is one of the best throws in the entire game, dealing an obscene 24!% on top of comboing into different moves such as u-air, n-air, and u-sp from low to high %s, that's just not fair!
She has 5 different taunts, up/down/left/right and neutral + taunt, her up taunt can spike opponents and deals 1%
In summery, if you really like crazy high damage combos, every move being a rekka, grabbing every chance you can get, and don't mind a mediocre recovery, Kung Fu Girl could be what you're looking for
