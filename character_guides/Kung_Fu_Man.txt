Kung Fu Man is here! No wicked magic powers, no fancy projectiles or tricks, just a man with a black belt and a dream to be the best at what he does!
KFM is a somewhat slow close quarters fighter with a mediocre recovery, he excels in grappling and hitting people really really hard
His jab is his best normal move and has 2 hits, the first one can combo into his grab and is amazing because of that, so ignore the 2nd one and try to get the timing down to run-up grab instead, the 2nd hit can whiff if you land the 1st from further away anyways, you can also cancel the first hit of jab into his other tilts, if you want to (5%, 7% = 12%)
F-tilt reaches barely further than his jab, and has less knockback than the 2nd hit of it, and doesn't even combo into anything, don't bother with this one (8%)
D-tilt has 2 hits, might be able to catch them after with an aerial, but it's inconsistent if they'll both hit or not, also doesn't combo into grab, don't use this much either (5, 7 = 12%)
U-tilt also has 2 hits, but again they don't really lead into anything, and hit at the same range jab does, so don't do it~ (5, 7 = 12%)
Dash attack is fine, can combo into jab/grab at pretty specific spacings/%s, otherwise it's decent for knocking the opponent away sometimes (7%)
F-smash is really strong, makes the most satisfying sound ever and gets far stronger if you hit at max charge, has pretty great range too due to KFM lunging forwards, good move (12 < 20%)
U-smash is also really strong, makes the most satisfying sound ever and gets far stronger if you hit at max charge,  sometimes the 2nd hit will whiff, especially if you attack an off-stage opponent with it (4, 10 = 14% < 4, 18 = 22%)
D-smash hits twice and is weaker than the other smashes, the 2nd hit can whiff sometimes too, don't use this one much, it doesn't make a cool sound... (4, 8 = 12% < 4, 14 = 18%)
N-Sp has KFM gain super armor while preparing a big strike, the strike has decent knockback, and the armor can be useful sometimes, but it's not that great, stalls in the air (12%)
F-Sp, KFM charges forwards like his dash attack, except it can destroy projectiles along the way, goes further in the air and is a pretty good help for his recovery, good move (9%)
U-Sp leaps up with a tiny kick, if it hits, KFM continues into a more powerful mega kick that can kill easily near the top, you'll want to practice B-reversing if you want to recover like a proper martial arts master, though.. (5, 10 = 15%)
D-Sp, winds up then lets loose 3 punches ending in a spectacular finish with the satisfying sound again, completely murders opponents but won't chase them off ledges unless you're airborne already, too slow to be useful most of the time, unless you get a shield break I guess (6, 6, 8 = 20%)
N-air stuns the opponent for a bit, but sends them nowhere, you can combo into jab/grab with this, you can also cancel into his other aerials aside from specials, outstanding move! (8%)
F-air and B-air are the same move on opposite sides, they send the opponent away and have decent range, nothing special really (6%)
U-air is a powerful vertical killing move, can combo into other moves at low %s if you land with it, great to have (6%)
D-air sends opponents down a bit, can sometimes combo into jab/grab if they land on stage, pretty nice (6%)
Finally, KFM's grab is one to be feared, the 2% pummel is a little faster than average, and his F-throw and B-throw are some of the strongest killing throws you'll see, they'll at least send the opponent off stage in most cases, his U-throw can kill if you're nowhere near a ledge, and D-throw can combo into air moves at ~0%, but is otherwise not very useful
In summery, if you want to play an honest grappler's game in a cast full of weirdos, Kung Fu Man could be what you're after
