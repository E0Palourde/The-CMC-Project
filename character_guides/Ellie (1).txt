Ellie overview time! Don't be fooled by her childish apperance, she is one of the most powerful fighters on the CMC cast, being mostly a zoner/spacer, but can do well in most situations
Her Jab has 5 hits, the last one doesn't combo but can spike and will bury grounded opponents, decent range too (2%x4, 5% = 15%)
Her F-tilt is quick and deals good damage, very good range too (12%)
U-tilt is fast and powerful, but has noticable recovery, can even kill if it hits at the start, incredible (16% in front, 8% above/behind)
D-tilt isn't as strong, but it lasts a while and moves you forward, and is slightly safer than U-tilt..Not great (7%)
Dash attack is a more mobile safer longer ranged d-tilt, much better, since Ellie's run speed is very fast (6%)
N-air is a quick hit like the first hit of jab, good range damage and knockback at low %s (7%)
U-air is slow to start and very weak, but it lasts for ages, not very good.. (5% foot, 2% leg)
D-air is a mighty falling spike that launches Ellie back up after it lands, stops all momentum in the air upon use (12%)
B-air is quick and very powerful and can spike if hit just right, great for killing near the ledge regardless (14% spike, 12% late)
F-air shoots a rocket that flies very far through the air, deals more damage the closer it is, wow (6% fist, 16% - 5% based on rocket distance)
F-smash fires a series of ring projectiles, dealing huge damage if they all hit as well as great knockback on the last one (6%, 2%x4, 9% = 24% < 14%, 3%, 3%, 4%, 4%  = 40%)
U-smash is the same as F-smash but firing straight upwards, amazing to prevent people from landing on top of you (2%x5, 12% = 22% < 5%, 3%, 4%, 3%, 4%, 15% = 34%)
D-smash is a slow roll into a strike into another slow roll to recover, much too slow and weaker than her other amazing smashes, don't use it (15% < 19%)
N-Sp has her helper charge forwards, won't stop until it leaves the stage or hits the opponent (7%), so long as it's charging, you can't use other specials or any grabs, instead getting a medium range peashooter as a special (2% N-Sp, 3% D-Sp, 7% F-Sp) and a close range exploding fist for an attack when you grab (but not dash grab, which will do nothing) (11%)
U-Sp helper launches Ellie up, Ellie deals damage to foes initially but both players can bounce off the helper too, ground version does no damage and doesn't last as long..When without a helper, Ellie will shoot downwards with a powerful spiking hit while being put into freefall, you can use both U-Sp's one after the other (6% air helper, 4% helperless fist, 15% helperless rocket)
F-Sp sends out a water bubble that is initially weak, but once it hits the ground creates a series of traveling pillars along the ground that combo into each other, great, if you turn around before the helper fires the bubble, it will fire in the opposite direction, you can turn again before the pillars form to have them go in either direction as well (6% inital bubble, 5% per pillar = 25% total)
D-Sp creates a gigantic bomb that explodes as soon as the opponent touches it, or if it's left there for a long while, it's amazing when used off stage since it's so large and can cover the ledge easily if it lands there, but if the opponent can keep away from it, you're left without a helper for a very long time (damage varies, max 32% at 10 hits)
Grab has surprising reach for a small fighter, pummel (4%) is somehow amazingly quick in spite of the high damage, F-throw (17%) is mostly for damage, can't combo or kill .. B-throw (13%) can kill easily near the ledge .. 
U-throw (13%) can also kill, but vertically, it can also combo to F-tilt even at kill % for some reason .. D-throw (12%) sends horizontally when facing right, and vertically when facing left, vertical version can also combo to jab and f-tilt at low %s for some reason
In summery, if you'd like a small powerhouse that can do lots of things almost too well, Ellie's for you
