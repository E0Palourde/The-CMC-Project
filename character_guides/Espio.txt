Espio overview time! He's a speedy chameleon ninja thing that has some interesting combos and maneuvers he can pull off, he's got a fine recovery and excels at punishing the opponent's mistakes
Jab takes 3 button presses and the first 2 hits can combo to the first 2 hits again on a loop, they can also combo to grab as well, 3rd hit has weak knockback/damage and isn't great to use over grab (2%x3 = 6%)
F-tilt is quick and has similar range to jab, it can also combo to grabs at low %s and has okay knockback at high %s, it's decent (4%)
U-tilt is great, really fast, good close hitbox, and can combo into itself, grabs, and aerials at most %s! (4%)
D-tilt slides really far, you can increase the distance further by dashing just before starting the move (same with U-tilt), it has a weaker hit in the later half that can combo to stuff, including F-Sp, this is preferred over the stronger hit unless your foe is at high %s (7% early, 6% late)
Dash attack  is really strong, sends at a bad angle for the opponent and is able to kill, very nice (12%)
F-Smash is both fast and strong, but has bad range, pretty good for punishing close by opponents (16% < 24%)
Both Espio's U-Smash and D-Smash can be improved with a technique I call a "hop-smash", if you simply jump and land, or do any aerial action and recover before you hit the ground, you can then do a smash (including charged ones) with full aerial control during it, If you hold forward as you land you can store the hop-smash as long as you want until you release forward or do any other action
U-Smash  is almost as fast as F-Smash and leaps to the air with a big kick, great for catching airborne foes and you can do air moves after, very good, can go backwards during a hop-smash (15% < 22%)
D-Smash teleports above and drills down, dealing knockback comparable to F-Smash's on the last hit, it's nice, especially when hop-smashed, but be careful, if you go off-stage with that, you'll drill to your death! (2%x?, 13% < 20%)
N-Sp tosses a quick but weak shuriken across the screen, it takes ~1.5 seconds before you can throw another unless it hits a shield, then you can throw another instantly, making it decent for shield pressure, you can also charge it for 1 second to instead throw a huge shuriken which locks the opponent in place and allows for a follow-up, including F-Sp, good if you can land it (4% < 1%x9, 4% = 13%)
F-Sp suddenly dashes forwards and knocks the opponent into the air, allowing for an aerial combo generally with F-air, or U-air but other moves could be useful as well even if they don't combo, use this to punish far away moves, or whenever really (10%)
U-Sp summons a whirlwind beneath and launches Espio up, it only knocks the opponent up on the last hit, allowing you to follow-up if you're good with timing, but it's use as an attack is unreliable at best and not worth going for much of the time (1%x7, 4% = 11%)
D-Sp on the ground turns Espio invisible where he can't be hurt, then charges one of two directions, goes the same distance as F-Sp, could maybe be used as a counter of sorts .. In the air, it becomes a quick diagonally downwards drill attack that spikes on the last hit, pretty nice (10% ground .. 1%x4 = 4% air)
N-air is quick and can combo to stuff on the ground at lower %s, gets worse at high %s though, still a nice move (7%)
F-air is also quick, even a bit more than N-air, and can be used for much the same things as it can, except it's a little worse at low %s and better at high %s due to the knockback angle it sends foes (7%)
B-air can spike at the heel right at the start, otherwise it's a stronger F-air, very good (8%) 
U-air is fast, can combo to itself and such at around low-mid %s, it's not that great at killing though but it can get the job done, pretty nice (6%)
D-air sends you down really far, dangerous off-stage, it can spike right at the start, has a weak hit after that can maybe combo to F-Sp or something at mid %s (10% early, 8% late)
Grab is fairly quick with passable range, pummel (2%) is average speed, B-throw (15%) is great for damage, positioning, and killing at the ledge, just great .. F-throw (12%) can also kill at the ledge, similar to B-throw but less damage in exchange for a better knockback angle .. U-throw (10%) can follow-up with an aerial at low %s, otherwise it can kill at high %s .. D-throw (9%) can chain into itself sometimes, as well as other moves, it's really good
In summery: If you want to be a pink ninja chameleon that dashes all over the place and is surprisingly powerful, you can't go wrong with Espio
