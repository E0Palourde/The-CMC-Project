Aria overview time! She's a potent rushdown fighter, able to confuse and mix-up her opponents fairly well with her quick movement and attacks, she excels at pressuring the opponent, and hit & run tactics too
Jab is a basic quick one-two swing, like a few other moves it doesn't actually hit at the tip of the sword (3%, 5% = 8%)
F-tilt okay range, can knock opponents back a bit, okay move, especially at the ledge (6%)
U-tilt cancels into U-smash by pressing the button again, fantastic move, but stops comboing at higher %s (6%)
D-tilt combos into u-tilt and some other stuff too, pretty nice to have (4%)
Dash attack  suddenly charges forwards a good distance, great for punishing opponents (8%)
F-smash very slow but very strong, use it if your opponent is wide open, otherwise it's very risky (11% < 18%)
U-smash is her best move, quick, relatively high damage, nice hitbox, and always combos into aerials after, don't go without it (15% < 22%)
D-smash quick, decent knockback, turns you around, okay move (10% < 18%)
N-Sp as far as I can tell does nothing but allows your D-Sp orbs to home in on the opponent for a while, this is really nice for keeping up the pressure if you have a spare moment to do it, but it has no indication for when it stops being locked on, so you'll have to do it regularly, and it won't make existing orbs start homing in
F-Sp a quick dash that can cancel into anything, including jumps, except shield and smash attacks, obviously great for moving around and confusing the opponent
U-Sp can be aimed somewhat by holding a direction, can also cancel into anything and you won't go into freefall (4%)
D-Sp launches 2 orbs that slowly float straight ahead unless locked on with N-Sp, pretty nice for pressure and can combo into/out of anything, but can only fire them right away again if they actually touch the opponent, otherwise you'll have to wait a long time.. (1% each)
N-air is great, quick with a huge hitbox and can combo into other stuff after, like F-air (1%x3, 3% = 6%)
F-air is pretty good too, does nice damage and actually hits underneath Aria initially (7%)
B-air is a tad slow and harder to hit compared to her other aerials,  but it can kill at higher %s, so it's still fairly useful (11%)
U-air has a large hitbox in front of her, decent for comboing at low %'s and juggling at mid-high %s but isn't too special (7%)
D-air lasts for a long time and sends opponents upwards, can combo into itself or other stuff at lower %s, great move (8%)
Grab is quick with good range and little recovery too, very nice .. Pummel (2%) is average speed, 
F-throw is incredibly strong near the ledge even at lower %s, sends at a nasty downwards angle, amazing (9%)
B-throw can kill too at high %s but not as well as F-throw or D-throw, doesn't really combo to anything either, it's not too useful (9%)
D-throw can also kill, but is still outclassed by F-throw at the ledge, it's a bit better at center stage though (6%)
U-throw is frankly almost totally useless, deals the last damage, can't kill nor combo (5%)
In summery, if you want to run circles around your opponent and wildly swing a sword around, with the occasional help from some orbs, Aria is a good choice
