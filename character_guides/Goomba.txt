Very light fighter, he's focused on quick combos and close range combat. Has quite the toolkit considering what it offers in terms of selfbuffs and horizontal/vertical range (horizontal with Down Smash and Side B and vertical with fully charged Down B), making Goomba into a very interesting character to try and rack up some awesome combos with.
Goomba has various cancellable moves in the ground, such as jab, dtilt and utilt. This is done so that you actually have to think before fighting Goomba head on because his moves are blunt, quick and go straight to the point; if he uses a fair, it goes straight in front of him. Not forward and up, not forward and down. Forward. His dair is a spike, his uair is literally his usmash in the air, his nair is a double hitting move. Basically, if you get hit by an experienced Goomba player and don't manage to retreat, you're gonna be in trouble.

Neutral B boosts Goomba's speed, air mobility, Up B height and most importantly, buffs the damage and knockback of smash attacks and throws by 1.5x for 5 seconds. Takes an additional 5 seconds of cooldown to use again. While the buffs are active however, weight is decreased by a drastic amount so you have to make sure to not get hit while using it, otherwise you're as good as dead.

Side B throws a mini goomba that is affected by gravity, can be used as a zoning/pressure tool.

Up B allows Goomba to sprout wings and take flight giving him an additional 4 "jumps" in midair, similar to that of Kirby's. You can cancel out of it with any aerial of your choosing, though you won't recover the 4 jumps until you land (for obvious reasons).

Down B has Goomba charge up a move that has three levels, each determining the amount of Goombas that will appear below him to charge directly upwards.

No final smash yet.
