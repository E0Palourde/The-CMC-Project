This character was made by Richárd Mohos/CloudStrifeHero and is not allowed
into any kind of modpack that isn't CMC/CMC+ without perimission!

ShadowSeraphimon's moveset doesn't need too much detailing, but he comes
with his own Arcade Route as well as plenty of palettes based not only
on the 10 Legendary Warriors, but even some more obscure stuff like
the original BlackSeraphimon from Digimon World 3.

Credits:
-Original ShadowSeraphimon sprites by DragonRod with plenty of extras by me.
-Pixel art by Deluxor23.
-Versus theme music reconstruction by DigiMusicMon.
