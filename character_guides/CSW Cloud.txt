Fighter leaning to the heavier side of the spectrum, can rack up simple combos with NAir and properly connecting his grounded Up B's hits.

Fully charging his Side Smash shoots out a Blade Beam.

Hitting enemies with the ending of his Up Smash will deal a substantial amount of damage compared to what its beginning part deals.

He has two aerial spikes; Down Air and Forward Air.
Down Air has considerable startlag but hits hard at a diagonal downwards angle.
Forward Air is his Meteor Slash, it has a bit more startlag than Down Air, but it's high risk, high reward off-stage; it'll send Cloud falling downwards until he hits someone with the attack, causing him to bounce back up as a result and basically guaranteeing the kill.

Neutral B: Magic. Cloud alternates between shooting Firaga and Blizzaga, in that order. Firaga is fast and has strong knockback, Blizzaga is slower and doesn't deal as much damage, but has a lot of hitstun.

Grounded Up B: Burning Climhazzard. it functions similarly to how it functions in Ultimate, but the double input is not required. On landing, it causes a burning spell to spawn on the floor around cloud, dealing multi-hit damage. Highly punishable on startup.

Aerial Up B: High Leap. with decent recovery capabilities, although it leaves Cloud vulnerable throughout its duration.

Down B: Double Slash - Finishing Touch/Aeroja. Cloud performs a two-combo move that doesn't do much normally. When the enemy reaches 130% damage, however, if the first hit connects it'll deal 1% but will also have tremendous knockback and spawn a multi-hit tornado around Cloud.

Final Smash: Enhanced Blade Beam. It's a bigger, way stronger version of his Blade Beam. It's highly telegraphed so it can be easily avoided by going behind him at a considerable distance before he shoots it. It can kill at as early as 50% if not careful, however.
