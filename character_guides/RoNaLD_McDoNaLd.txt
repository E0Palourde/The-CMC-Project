Jab is the cornerstone of His broken combo-game, combos out of F-tilt/D-tilt and then into a Smash/U-Sp which combos to aerials, especially B-air to kill. (4, 6, 8 = 18%)
F-tilt has good range, can cancel into jab, d-tilt, and dash attack, will whiff other moves if you hit at the tip, do F-tilt again to go into dash attack, which will almost always hit after (5%) 
D-tilt cancels to jab, u-tilt, and dash attack, only go for jab after, it cancels to the same stuff but just piles on extra damage (5%)
U-tilt doesn't cancel into anything other than jump, generally just a worse up special aside from the amazing hitbox (7%)
Dash attack is powerful, but a tad slow compared to His other moves, only use it at higher %s (9%)
F-smash kills. can cancel into U-Sp before the 4th hit, a bit risky to just throw out as it actually has some recovery, doesn't work great at point blank.. (3%, 3, 5, 6 = 17% < 10%, 10, 12, 12 = 44%)
U-Smash kills off the top, doesn't combo after or cancel into anything, can rarely whiff a hit, whiffs more if you're running before doing it, as you'll slide forwards (5%, 5, 7 = 17% < 12%, 12, 14 = 38%)
D-Smash: He's holding back, slow and weak with noticeable recovery, forget it (10% < 16%)
N-Sp: tap to throw a Big Mac™️ has high priority and deals decent knockback, same in the air.. Hold on the ground to throw 4 that combo to each other, only the last one has substantial knockback (5% per)
F-Sp: tosses the Apple of Enlightenment down, will lie in wait and violently burst open upon contact with the opponent or after 5 seconds, harms Him as well, and kills shields (22%)
U-Sp: leaps up with a soaring kick, can press Sp again to do an instant spiking kick similar to D-air, can cancel into N-air, U-air, and B-air too (9%)
D-Sp: fry wall reflects projectiles, D-Sp in air leaps backwards while throwing a spread shot of 4 Big Macs™️ , good (Fries 7% each, Big Macs™️ 5% each)
N-air cancels to any other aerial except F-air, great to do B-air or D-air after (5%)
F-air is fast and chains into itself and any aerial, will pop Him up a bit higher too (5%)
B-air kills. (8%)
U-air isn't very good, doesn't combo into anything after, like U-air only good for its hitbox, ignore it (7%)
D-air kills. and strangely only hits in front of Him, not below (12%)

Grab is ... G o o d  ..Pummel is totally average speed (2%) 
F-throw can send into Apple (13%)
B-throw kills, can spike if you grab right at the ledge too, great move! (13%)
U-throw is just uncharged U-smash but in grab form, kills at about the same time (15%)
D-throw ...Nowhere is safe, He will catch you, He will kill you (75%)

In summery: Have a happy meal!
