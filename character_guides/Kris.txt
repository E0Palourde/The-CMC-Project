Kris and friends overview time! Kris is an agile sword fighter that relies heavily on their meter, which increases as they deal damage, each attack fills the meter slightly different amounts, they excel at pressuring the opponent
Kris has an alt called passive, it lets their meter passively regenerate at a rate of about 1% per second, taking 100 seconds to reach max if you don't use any other moves, but the meter gained from landing attacks is halved, it's up to you which you want
Jab is a quick 2 hit attack with short range, decent knockback on the last hit too, fine move (4%, 5% = 9%)
F-tilt is a bit slow but has nice range, as well as a sweetspot at the tip, can kill sometimes too (7%, 10% tip)
U-tilt is fast, combos into itself and aerials like N-air and U-air, covers a great range all above Kris, very very nice (8%, 5% behind hit)
D-tilt might can combo into a grab, u-tilt, or jab, but isn't as easy to land as U-tilt, still good though (6%)
Dash attack slides in, can combo into grab sometimes, it's alright (8%)
F-smash has some recovery but is otherwise quick and good at killing, builds a decent amount of meter too, great move (12% < 20%)
U-smash calls on Susie to help, has a large hitbox and is strong, but is a tad slower than F-smash, another nice move, can slide forward by doing it out of a run (14% < 22%)
D-smash calls on Ralsei to help, hits behind then in front, least range of the smashes, worst damage, and can't kill well.. Ralsei isn't meant for fighting (2% back hit, 10% < 18% front hit)
N-Sp requires at least 40% meter and calls on Jevil to help, shoots out a super quick boomeranging projectile that traps opponents in and delivers them to you for a free follow-up, fantastic but be careful you don't miss and waste your meter.. (8%) 
F-Sp fires a Rude Buster with help from Susie, normally requires 15% meter, but when glowing red/yellow beyond 75% meter, requires 30% but is greatly powered up going further and faster, seemingly no way to do 15% version if you're beyond 75%, it's a decent projectile but again you have to be pretty sure it can hit (6% weak, 15% strong)
U-Sp goes upwards with no hitbox, can go double distance but requires 20% meter for that, you can still do the meterless version by tapping the special button instead of holding it
D-Sp has Kris glow blue, slowly draining their meter over time, becoming slower and jumping less high, as well as being unable to gain meter from attacks, but gaining a 50% damage buff on all moves other than jab, pummel, and N-Sp, this is amazing, be sure to use it often especially once you're past 40% meter so you still have access to N-Sp, using D-Sp will change you back to your agile mode, and put D-Sp on cooldown for 3 seconds
N-air is great, super fast and hits twice, can combo out of lots of moves and into itself sometimes too (3%, 3% = 6%)
F-air is a big slow spike that has a sourspot above Kris, a great move for finishing off foes and the sweetspot is easy to land (6% sour, 12% sweet)
B-air is average speed with a nice hitbox, good at the ledge of course (9%)
U-air is quick and nice for juggling foes, usually can't kill all that well though (7%)
D-air is very good despite the small hitbox, fast and can spike at the last hit, combos into other things if the foe is on the ground, if the last hit doesn't connect you can do a grab or u-tilt, if it does you can combo into an aerial (2%x4 = 8%)
Grab is quick and has decent range, hooray .. Pummel (2%) is also very quick, use it often .. D-throw (9%) is incredible and can combo into pretty much everything, including F-smash,    F-air, N-Sp, and U-tilt to name a few .. U-throw (14%) and F-throw (15%) can't combo or kill, and are mostly for positioning .. B-throw (14%) can kill at very high %s, but that's about it, just stick with D-throw 
In summery: If you want to be a weirdly well-rounded sword fighter that wins battles through the power of friendship and meter management, make Kris under your control
