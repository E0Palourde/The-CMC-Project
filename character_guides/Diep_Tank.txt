Diep Tank overview time! Strangely for a tank it has no treads, and just slowly floats around.. So, DT's moveset consists almost entirely of straight path projectiles that push itself back when fired, it obviously excels at zoning, but isn't entirely helpless up close or vs a reflector, none of its bullets go through platforms, and most can be stopped by opponent's attacks..
DT's jab quickly fires a weak shot, can be spammed to force opponents into the air and does a little knockback, nice move (5%)
F-tilt has some more recovery than jab, but the shot goes further and deals more damage/knockback, can combo after jab at the right distance (7%)
U-tilt shoots a spread of 5 bullets at once to hit above, in front, and below DT, one of your only ways to hit aerial foes, it's pretty good (3% per, 15% point blank)
D-tilt lays a caltrop(?) on the ground that stays there for a few seconds, the direction the opponent is launched in is determined whether it hits them in the front or back, allowing you to possibly combo into other things as they fly towards you, also good for using at the ledge (8%)
Dash attack rushes forwards while spraying out weak bullets from behind to boost, and attacking with more from the front, DT itself can hurt opponents and it's surprisingly powerful, can mash the button to keep dash attacking (2% per bullet, 10% body slam)
F-smash launches a slow powerful bullet that blasts foes away, it deals great damage, but isn't that good at killing early (18% < 27%)
U-smash is like U-tilt but bigger: fires a huge spread of 9 bullets, the one that goes straight ahead is strongest, fantastic move (7% for center, 4% for others, 39% at point blank   < 11% for center, 5% for others, 52%! at point blank)
D-smash shoots a weak, medium, then strong bullet forward that all travel quickly and combo after each other, another good move (4, 4, 8 = 16% < 6, 6, 12 = 24%) 
N-Sp turns DT invisible and invincible for up to ~2 seconds, stalling in the air, they will reappear automatically when right near an opponent and attack, this is obviously great if the opponent is trying to rush you down, but it can still trade with the opponent if they have a hitbox on you as you reappear, can cancel this any time by pressing a button, useful for mixing up your landing and such (12%)
F-Sp fires a constant barrage of bullets that fly in semi-random directions and don't flinch the opponent, okay for racking up damage but you generally have better things to do with your time (3%)
U-Sp blasts a huge slow bullet downwards while launching DT up somewhat, the bullet can spike opponents, making it deadly off-stage, and is one of your main ways of killing, great move, but a little risky to just throw out (18%)
D-Sp summons 4 homing spikes to encircle DT for 5 seconds, has a cooldown of 6 seconds before you can use it again, will chase down opponents that come close, even through walls, can combo into most moves with their help, or go for a grab, or just deter enemies from approaching you, fantastic move (4% per, 16% total)
N-air is just like jab but in the air
F-air and B-air are just like F-tilt but in the air, and B-air turns you around
U-air is just like U-tilt but in the air
D-air is just like D-tilt but in the air
Grab is slow but has decent range, pummel is average speed and 2%, none of DT's throws combo into anything, they at least do passable damage and all but D-throw have decent knockback, D-throw deals 13%, F-throw 9%, U-throw 7%, and B-throw 10%
In summery, if you want to launch so many projectiles at your opponent that you eventually manage to kill them or they give up in frustration, Diep Tank is a good choice
