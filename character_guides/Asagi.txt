Asagi overview time! They're decently fast with an average but vulnerable recovery, they excel at pressuring the opponent and do well at most ranges, especially up close..They also rely on bullets for a majority of their moves, and can have a max of 30, all bullet moves start off strong but get weaker as they travel, no longer flinching the opponent once they turn dark, and while out of bullets, moves that spend them become totally useless.. let's start with their specials first:
N-Sp shoots a slow moving electric ball that briefly stuns opponents, good for going in behind it in relative safety, or edgeguarding
F-Sp causes them to dash super quick, can be jump canceled along with canceled into any other move, can also do it once again after a jump, air dodge, or even up special
U-Sp jumps into the air before firing down 5 bullets, can cancel with any other move during it to fire less bullets too, doesn't need bullets to jump
D-Sp reloads 20 bullets per use, but takes a while, you can start running then use it to slide along the ground, or cancel it out of F-Sp to slide even further
Their jab is a quick close range attack that can combo into other moves at low %s, or possibly into another jab if you use F-Sp instantly after, then cancel into a jab
F-tilt fires a bullet forward and recovers extremely quickly, great after a jab or just in general while you're close
D-tilt fires 2 bullets ahead, can combo into itself and air moves if hits close, great move
U-tilt hops up a bit and fires a big bullet slightly upwards, just enough time to fire off an aerial shot after
Dash attack rolls and then shoots 2 bullets ahead, can combo into jab or another tilt easily, decent move but a tad slow
Their aerials all can be extended as long as you want by holding the button down..A glitch makes it so if you try to C-stick them, they'll be unable to be released until you touch the ground again, leaving you to die if you tried it off-stage.. 
N-air, F-air, and B-air are the exact same move from what I can tell, rapid-fires bullets straight ahead, very nice, and B-air turns you around
U-air fires bullets straight up, can kill if done right, excellent move
D-air is crazy, rapid fires bullets diagonally downwards, with a powerful spiking hitbox at point blank, due to its extremely quick startup like all the other bullet moves, allows you to easily terrify off-stage foes if they can't contest your bullet storm, this move is likely too good!
F-smash brings out a gigantic super powerful flail that flies straight ahead! It's slow to start and not disjointed, so things can still go poorly for you, but it's great for killing
U-smash swings the flail straight up, not as far reaching as F-Smash, but it's still very powerful
D-smash swings the flail all around you with a huge hitbox to match, it's the weakest of the 3 but easily the hardest to deal with
Their grab has surprisingly good range, their pummel is average, B-throw and D-throw combo into things at low %s, F-throw can kill at the ledge, and U-throw spends 5 bullets for a good kill move, with less than 5 bullets though it has no knockback and shouldn't be used
In summery, if you want a speedy powerhouse with tricky combos and resource management, Asagi is for you
