Master-Johnny-Handoogly the 3rd, AKA John Googly, is a weird close range fighter that arguably has to be too close range to land some of his moves, but if you can look past this glaring flaw, he's got neat stuff to offer, and excels in pressuring the opponent
His jab is a double slap with passable range and damage, can't combo into anything though, it's okay (4%, 5% = 9%)
F-tilt is a poke with a very tiny hitbox, at least it's really quick (8%)
U-tilt is great and combos into air moves and itself at lower %s, though the second hit can whiff if you aren't literally inside the opponent though.. Could go for a grab if that happens I guess (4, 5, = 9%)
D-tilt is a slide then retreat move that actually has some range, hooray, too bad it doesn't combo into anything or kill, but at least it pops the opponent into the air, which might help I guess (7%)
Dash attack sends the opponent nowhere, but stuns them long enough for a possible follow-up, such as D-smash or F-smash, unfortunately it usually leaves the opponent behind you at lower %s, making following up awkward.. (8%)
F-Smash is genuinely incredible and one of John's best moves, it starts and ends almost instantly, on top of having good damage and knockback, as well as sending John hurtling towards his foe, solving his range issue! It can even go down off platforms to attack in the air (including fastfalling once airborne to go even further downwards), abuse this move (14% < 20%)
U-Smash is bad, hits 4 times, slower to start than the other smashes, doesn't land on most characters on the ground, and you can't move around once you initiate the move, it's also weaker than F-Smash unless fully charged, but nobody is gonna let you hit it like that (1% x4 = 4% < 8% x4 = 32%)
D-Smash is amazing, you can move around during it to solve it's range issue, and if charged even a little, deals absurd damage, abuse this move too (knockback based on which side John is facing) (12% < 60%!?)
N-Sp is pretty great for harassment, a simple and fast projectile that tosses the opponent into the air, good move, not much else to say (5%)
F-Sp is a slower to start, weaker, longer lasting F-Smash that can also be done freely in the air... Has some niche uses for movement and recovery I'm sure, but F-Smash is almost always the better option otherwise (12%)
U-Sp spirals upwards, good quick recovery, but extremely unreliable if you'll actually land all the hits, only the last one has any knockback, strictly use it to recover (1% x9 = 9%)
D-Sp is a slow hop up (even in the air) then a stomp downwards... Nearly useless, you have a much better spiking attack anyways (10%)
N-air is lightning fast and can combo into itself and other aerials, incredible move but can be a bit awkward to hit (5%)
F-air is a decent quick move to throw out occasionally, won't be killing though (9%)
B-air is a bit slower than F-air, but can kill easier, so it's pretty good (12%)
U-air like U-Sp is unreliable to hit all of them, fortunately you can drag your opponent down to the ground to combo them after, making it a decent tool (1% x7, 2% for final hit, 9% total)
D-air launches John downwards with almost no startup or recovery, drilling straight through his opponent to finish them off, each hit is a spike that deals great damage and knockback! learn to love this move (9% x4 = 36%)
It's John, so his grab has pathetic range too, pummel is average and deals 2%, his throws are pretty good though, F-throw (4%) and B-throw (6%) both can combo into F-Smash, F-throw combos even at high %s while B-throw can kill then, meanwhile D-throw (10%) can kill at high %s and spike at the ledge, while U-throw can combo into aerials and such, and kill at high %s
In summery, if you like smash attacks, slapping things, and disobeying social distancing guidelines, maybe you should lend Googly a hand
