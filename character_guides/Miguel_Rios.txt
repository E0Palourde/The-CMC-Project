Miguel Rios overview time! He's a rather unique fighter with pretty nice close range options, but can fight at mid range decently as well, he excels at punishing opponent's mistakes and probably can do most other stuff too
Jab is very quick and short ranged,  fine to spam, also has good knockback (5%)
F-tilt is almost as quick as jab, but with better range and slightly less good knockback due to the angle, has a late/tip hitbox that sends nowhere but can combo to other moves, overall very nice (5% early, 2% late/tip)
U-tilt is a tad slow but reaches up well, can combo to other moves like aerials around mid %s, pretty good (9%)
D-tilt is quick and can maybe combo to grab at mid %s, but it has no range and just hits inside of Miguel, while also taking a bit of time to recover, making it not worth the risk at all (7%)
Dash attack is like a stronger F-tilt, has the same range and late hitbox as F-tilt, but it can't combo as well due to having more recovery, still pretty nice (8% early, 2% late)
F-Smash is a big slow powerful punch with surprisingly large range, good to use to guard the ledge (16% < 24%)
U-Smash is a big slow powerful u-tilt that hits twice in front but has a slightly behind hit that won't combo with the first 2, it's a decent move (4%, 10% = 14% < 6%, 20% = 26% .. 13% < 19% behind hit)
D-Smash is quick and powerful but only hits behind Miguel while extending his hurtbox far forwards, making it risky unless as a close punish, it's worth a try (19% < 26%)
N-Sp launches a chargeable straight fireball that increases in speed and damage the longer you hold the button, very good to use to snipe or just toss out a slow one to get in your foe's way, cannot cancel or store the charge in any way (4% < 15%)
F-Sp charges forwards and then a 2nd time, can choose to not go as far in the air by holding backwards, if you hit your foe (or their shield) with the 1st charge, Miguel will try to teleport to them for the 2nd hit, afterwards you can usually follow-up with any quick move like D-smash, jab, an aerial, U-Sp, or even another F-Sp, great move (3%, 3%)
U-Sp makes Miguel quickly and violently spin around and rise up before going into freefall, it's not too easy to land all the hits, but the last one is fairly strong especially high up in the air, decent recovery too (4% 1st hit, 1%x5, 3% 7th hit, 1% 8th hit, 7% last hit)
D-Sp has Miguel gain super armor (unable to take knockback) while winding up the ultimate punch, after a moment he'll swing down and spike anybody nearby with great knockback, a very nice move that can sorta be used like a counter-attack, also conserves your momentum while charging, use it right after starting a dash to go flying! (20%)
N-air spins all around with a decent hitbox, can combo to other aerials or jab/tilts if it hits a grounded foe, fairly good move (5%)
F-air and B-air are the same move but B-air turns Miguel around, they both startup nearly instantly, have okay range, last a long while, and deal good damage with decent knockback, pretty good (9%)
U-air is a little slow to start but fairly powerful, knockback depends on which side Miguel is facing, has slightly more range behind him (10%)
D-air is great, super fast startup spike that's active for a little while, use it all the time when above an off-stage opponent, and even on-stage too if you want (9%)
Grab has fine range, pummel (2%) is average, F-throw (10%) is mostly for damage and positioning, the opponent can fall down if they get in the air during it, but the last hit should always connect anyways .. B-throw (8%) can kill nicely at the ledge at high %s, until then it's just good for getting your foe off-stage .. U-throw (8%) is for positioning as it can't kill or combo, not too great .. D-throw (6%) can spike off-stage, but that's about it
In summery: if you want somebody unconventional, while having a few familiar feeling moves as well, give Miguel a chance
