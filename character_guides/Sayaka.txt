Sayaka overview time! She's an average speed mostly defensive swordfighter with pretty good range and quick attacks, she can struggle a bit if the opponent gets too close for comfort, she excels at poking and spacing foes out
Jab is 2 hits and has great range especially on the 2nd one, the 1st hit can combo into itself over and over with great timing, while the 2nd has good knockback (3%, 5% = 8%)
F-tilt is a quick long range stab, good for stopping approaches and generally being annoying with it, has good knockback too (5%)
U-tilt can follow-up to aerials such as N-air and F-air at low %s, it can kill at high %s especially on a platform too, nice (5%)
D-tilt is fast and at low-mid%s can combo into jab and aerials, very nice aside from the short range (7%)
Dash attack is similarly short ranged but with a taller hitbox at least, otherwise it has some recovery and can't really combo, nor kill until high %s, not worth it most of the time (7%)
F-smash is relatively fast, and deals nice damage and knockback too, very nice (14% < 22%)
U-smash is strong and decent and protecting your head from airborne threats (14% < 22%..  12% < 20% for sourspot above head)
D-smash has amazing range, but can be a bit misleading as it stops right before the little vertical line forms, also struggles to kill compared to F-smash (14% < 22%)
N-Sp carelessly fires two backup swords at the opponent at average speed, has a decently long recovery and can't kill, but is good for longer range harassment (4% each = 8%)
F-Sp has two versions depending on if you tilt/hold, or smash the stick forward when pressing the button, the smash version does nothing in the air, not even the tilt version unfortunately, but on the ground it does a slow leaping 2 hit slice, best at low %s since it combos to jab and grab (2%, 9% = 11%)
The tilt version of F-Sp sends her flying forwards, great for recovering, also does good knockback on the last hit but usually whiffs that, can combo to jab on the ground after if you hit just right at low %s, nice move (1%x7, 3% last hit = 11%)
U-Sp goes up and forward before putting her in freefall, a decent recovery, but you'll have to learn how to B-reverse to get the most out of it, can't kill or combo into stuff (14%)
D-Sp is a very long lasting counter that takes a few frames to start up, invincible for a bit after countering so it's not useless vs projectiles either, a really good move, though it lasts so long that foes can react and grab you (14%)
N-air is slow to start but has a huge hitbox and good knockback, can sometimes combo to jab if you land on a grounded foe without the last hit, while the last hit can combo to tilts at close to 0%, great move (3%, 3%, 6% = 12%)
F-air is comparitively short ranged but is fast and can kill near the ledge, decent (11%)
B-air is quick and has amazing horizontal range comparable to f-tilt, can also kill at high %s, very nice (9%)
U-air is strong, similar to u-smash, and can juggle decently enough, nice to have (9%)
D-air is great, passable range and spikes the opponent, allowing for easy edgeguarding and kills (9%)
Grab has average range but is rather slow, especially the running version, pummel (1%) is at least quick .. B-throw (10%) can't kill and is just for positioning .. U-throw (8%) isn't great at killing either but it can get the job done ... D-throw (9%) is much better at killing ... F-throw (7%) at low %s can combo into jab or go for another grab, while at high %s it becomes your strongest throw, especially at the ledge, killing even earlier than smash attacks sometimes! So stick with F-throw
In summery: If you want a seemingly simple but effective swordswoman with some neat stuff sprinkled in there too, give Sayaka a try
