Rock Howard overview time! He's quite a well rounded fighter with average weight, run speed, jump height, and vertical recovery, along with superior horizontal recovery, that relies a lot on his super meter, which fills by varying amounts as you land attacks, as such I'll be explaining how many uses of an attack it takes to fill it up to 1 out of the max of 5 bars, he excels at combos and whatever else he wants to do, and is suitable for players of all skill levels, also he always automatically faces the opponent
All of Rock's non-special attacks will cancel to specials and supers
Jab has 3 hits and is short ranged, but also quick and your main combo starter, can combo to all of Rock's specials and supers on the first 2 hits at any %, except D-Sp (2%, 2%, 3% = 7%) ((21 hits, or 7 full jab combos))
F-tilt has decent range and is also a combo starter, and can even combo to D-Sp, but it has a bit of recovery, decent move (5%) ((21 hits))
U-tilt is fast and even shorter ranged than jab, it can combo into anything, including smashes, grab, and itself at lower %s, as well as specials and supers like normal, making it very dangerous to be hit by, probably too good.. (8%) ((21 hits)) 
D-tilt is about the same range as jab, but can't combo quite as well, it's not really worth using over jab.. (3%) ((21))
Dash attack is somewhat quick, similar range to jab, and quite powerful, due to this it struggles to combo past very low %s, but it's still great to use at high %s (9%) ((21))
F-Smash is stronger than dash attack, but has even shorter range and more recovery, still it's nice to have as a close range punish or after a shield break (12% < 20%) ((21, charging doesn't change meter gain))
U-Smash is similar in range than F-Smash, but has a taller hitbox, is slightly weaker and comes with less recovery, you get more meter too, it's pretty good(11% < 18%) ((11))
D-Smash is simply the best smash aside from it only hitting low, it recovers as fast as U-Smash while being more powerful than F-Smash, and having better range than both the others and sending at a nasty horizontal angle for the opponent! (13% < 20%) ((21))
After several of Rock's specials he will automatically do a hair flip taunt, this prevents you from shielding normally, but can be canceled to any other action including movement, so it's not really an issue except in the case of F-Sp going off-stage, you can only cancel it then with an aerial attack
N-Sp can be tapped to fire a single quick projectile that travels along the ground a good distance, can hold the button instead for a stronger projectile that also hits at close range once before the projectile starts traveling, in the air the projectile is weaker but much faster (8% projectile, 4% close strong, 6% aerial) ((6 single, 61 aerial!))
F-Sp can be tapped for a charge attack, and held for a charge attack with more recovery, but it will do an extra hit upon reaching your foe, the held version can be held further to repeatedly use F-Sp in the air, allowing for easy horizontal recovery over long distances as long as you aren't hit or let go of the button, since you can normally only do 1 F-Sp in the air (including F-A+B) (7% tap, 15% hold) ((13 tap, 7 hold))
U-Sp is a decent vertical recovery with only a little bit of horizontal momentum, it's also a high risk high reward attack, granting you lots of meter, damage, and knockback if you can land all 8 hits, but leaves you wide open if you miss or your foe falls out of it early, be careful with it (2%x7, 5% final hit = 19%) ((2 if all hits connect!!))
D-Sp when tapped goes into a running stance that's actually noticeably faster than normal running, you can only run towards your opponent, press A while running to do a quick invincible dodge, press shield/grab/run for a while to end the stance, taking about as long to do so as the quick dodge.. Press B to leap up and do a downwards punch that can spike foes at the end of it's hitbox, if you do it in the air you'll go straight into the downwards punch (12%) ((Meter gain varies heavily based on how much further you travel after hitting your foe, do it at the start of the jumping D-Sp for best results))
N-A+B is a super quick tall hitbox that is about as strong as uncharged U-Smash, when activated it freezes yourself and the opponent for a moment, but not any active projectiles, can only be done on the ground and takes 1 bar of meter to use, for some reason after using this move you have greatly reduced meter gain until you use N-Sp, F-Sp, or F-A+B again (this includes whiffing them, so it's not a big issue) (1%x5, 6% final hit = 11%)
F-A+B is another super quick attack that freezes just you and your opponent, then dashes forwards and hits everything horizontal to Rock, one of your strongest attacks and easily comboable out of a tilt or aerial, takes 1 bar of meter to use (11%)
If you have 2 or more bars filled in your meter, you can press Taunt + Special to activate Super Special moves which both consume 2 bars and can also be canceled from all the same moves the regular Supers and specials can
Pressing Taunt + N-Sp on the ground is a more damaging N-A+B attack, complete with the glitch where you need to use N-Sp or F-Sp after to be able to properly regain meter again, but it sends the opponent horizontally in the direction Rock is facing instead of vertically, this is less potent at killing than the A+B supers, but at least it deals more damage I guess, not really worth spending 2 valuable bars if you ask me.. Unless you hit the opponent's shield, in which case it will almost certainly break it! Go for it if your opponent is being very defensive (17%)
Pressing Taunt + F-Sp on the ground or air gets you a more damaging F-A+B that sends the opponent vertically and only needs to hit once to do an automatic combo with huge knockback at the end, this is easily the better of the two Super Specials and can kill very early if you catch the opponent high up, canceling an aerial into this is especially effective (15%)
N-air is quick but only hits below Rock, a great combo starter into F-A+B in the air, or basically any grounded move (8%) ((11))
F-air is similar to N-air but does more damage and hits higher up, another great combo starter but works best at low %s (9%) ((24))
B-air has about the same range as F-air but with a wider hitbox and hits a little lower, isn't as good with combos but is a tad stronger, somewhat difficult to make use of since Rock automatically faces his opponent (10%) ((14))
U-air is fast and covers everywhere above Rock, can easily combo to itself, other aerials, U-Sp, and sometimes F-A+B (7%) ((Minimum 7, meter gain varies based on based on how much of the attack is left after hitting your foe, hit as early as you can for best results))
D-air is a quick but very short range spike right in front of Rock, great for finishing off recovering foes of course, and can combo out of other attacks well enough (12%) ((22))
Grab is slightly short ranged but a bit faster than average too, pummel is basic aside from the great meter gain (2%) ((7)) .. F-throw has poor knockback and can't combo well either, best to just toss a foe off-stage for some damage (10%) ((31)) ... B-throw is very powerful, one of Rock's best killing moves without meter ready, and best moves in general; fantastic for killing, damage, and meter gain (14%) ((8))
U-throw can't kill, combo, or even send that far, at best it can combo to N-A+B when D-throw can't at high %s, not good.. (10%) ((31)) ... D-throw deals good damage and can spike off-stage foes, can even combo to N-A+B sometimes, very good (12%) ((31))
In summery: If you want a combo focused all-rounder that has a super meter and a surprising amount of depth to them, Rock Howard is a great choice for you
