Nika overview time! Let's go over their toolset! They're quite fast overall, and are good at most ranges, but excel up close
Jab is a fine short range 4 hit attack that can combo to F-tilt at low %s (2%, 1%, 1%, 5%  =  9%)
F-tilt has great range and can hit 4 times like jab, the second hit of this move can combo to N-Sp, which you should do regularly (3%, 2%, 1%, 8%  = 16%)
U-tilt is a tad slow but sends opponents high up, can kill at later %s, decent enough (8%)
D-tilt is the last hit of F-tilt but with more damage, can go off the ledge with it, it's alright (1%, 8% = 9%)
Dash attack charges forward with a drill (or large screwdriver?) and can carry opponents off-stage easily, very nice (2%x6, 4% = 16%)
F-smash is decently powerful, hits right in front of them with a wrench, great for killing at the ledge (14% < 22%)
D-smash swings in a half circle in front to behind Nika, does the most damage but isn't as good at killing (18% < 28% in front, 17% < 25% behind)
U-smash fires laser eyes! Either straight up or straight forward if you hold forward on your control stick before they shoot, can slide along the ground during this by running first, very nice for edgeguarding or juggling foes above you (15%, charging this does nothing)
N-air is quick and sends opponents away and downwards, can probably combo into other moves if it hits at lower %s, good for sending off-stage (8%)
F-air and B-air both have good range and knock the opponent decently far away, F-air hits twice while B-air turns you around, F-air can combo into stuff at low %s (2%, 8% = 10% f-air .. 9% b-air)
U-air catches the opponent if it hits early, otherwise swings behind for mediocre damage, if it catches you can hold up/down/left/right to throw them in that direction, if you touch the ground later on in the move you'll become knocked down without the ability to tech, this does let you use your get-up attack freely though, which is shockingly strong, dealing 20% with great knockback (6% initial hit, 3% toss, 4% down-toss, 6% back hit)
D-air screws the opponent again, only dealing substantial knockback on the last hit, Nika will bounce off the ground and restore their double jump during this move, allowing for continued air shenanigans (2%x6, 4% = 16%)
N-Sp does a close range two-part strike with the wrench, debuffing the opponent for about 5 seconds on the 2nd hit, while debuffed they will run slower, jump less high, and take more knockback, devastating if they're sent off-stage at the time, the 2nd hit also ignores shields! (1%, 6% = 7%)
F-Sp winds up a giant hammer swing that always spikes downwards, can hold the hammer out to wait as long as you want, but cannot cancel it (16%)
D-Sp holds out a laser pointer that zaps the opponent, has decent range but looks like it reaches further than it actually does, completely ignores shields (4%)
U-Sp jumps up with a strike all around them, mediocre recovery and damage, also puts them into Helpless state if you've already used your double jump, if you havn't yet, you're free to act after, but it takes your double jump still (9%)
Grab has good range, pummel (2%) is nice and quick, F-throw (4%) and B-throw (7%) kill at ledge, D-throw (12%) and U-throw (8%) combo into aerials, D-throw is better at comboing
In summery, if you want a fast character that can do a little of everything, Nika has the tools to get the job done
