Nitori overview time! She's got a helicopter backpack and other wacky gadgets to fight with, she generally has good range and fares well in the air along with the ground, she excels at edgeguarding and keeping the opponent out of her personal space
Nitori has 3 total jumps as well as a hover that lasts around 1 and a half seconds you can do by holding jump at any time, can hover on the ground or in the middle of your jump animation by holding down in addition to jump
Jab is a quick automatic 2 hit with decent knockback, good for getting foes off of you (3%, 3% = 6%)
F-tilt lasts for a little while and therefore can be good at the ledge, but it deals an unreliable # of hits and barely knocks back, not really worth it most of the time (2%x7? = 14%)
U-tilt is a nice quick disjointed anti-air, but it's long-ish recovery means it can't combo and is risky to just throw out randomly (1%, 1%, 3% = 5%)
D-tilt is a pathetic poke at the ground, poor range and damage, knockback is passable at high %s, otherwise useless (2%)
Dash attack charges forwards at high speed, has a small hitbox though, but the charge helps a lot, bad at low %s, but can kill nicely otherwise (4%)
F-smash is decently quick with good range, but deals low damage, it has fine knockback though and pushes Nitori backwards, making it quite safe, good move (4% < 12%)
U-smash is a powerful anti-air drill with a small-ish hitbox that can kill as long as the opponent doesn't fall out of it before the last hit, nice (10% < 25%)
D-smash is another powerful drill, this time sliding along the ground, the last hit can whiff if you do it from too close though, so be careful (10% < 24%)
N-Sp sends out a.. thingy, that explodes into a vertical laser beam? You can hold the button down to charge it and make it bounce along the ground further, it is extremely difficult to aim well, but it is worth it since it allows you to run in and pressure the opponent, and combo into basically whatever you want if you're close enough when it lands..It's useless against shields though (3%x7 = 21%)
F-Sp is yet another drill, the more you charge the further you fly, can easily carry a foe off-stage with this, or yourself if you're not careful, will stall in the air while charging and is great for recovering too, good move (12% < 42%)
U-Sp stops in place before launching in the desired direction, and allows you 4 seconds to aim a hook from left, up-left, up, up-right, or right, you can do this twice before touching the ground again, allowing you to easily stall in the air for over 10 seconds, the hook can get enemies but not shielding ones, you'll ram into foes too (1% hook, 5% tackle)
D-Sp spins a large object around Nitori up to 5 times and lets her move around freely, as well as gently float down if done airborne, each spin increases the speed of the following projectile toss once the button is released or held to the max, cannot spin again until the tossed projectile is gone, good move  (2% per spin, 3% projectile)
All of Nitori's air moves will keep going if she lands on the ground with them, aside from D-air
N-air is quick and hits 4 times, the last hit can combo to jab or U-tilt against a grounded foe, while in the air it spikes instead, this is great, but it's very difficult to land the move.. (2%x3, 4% = 10%)
F-air charges forwards while attacking with the propellers, a fantastic move to carry foes off-stage and to help with recovering, goes down if you use it two or more times in the air (2%x6, 3% = 15%)
B-air is just like jab but in the air, very good to have a more mobile version of it (3%, 3% = 6%)
U-air is just like U-tilt but in the air, again nice to have a more mobile version, good for juggling (1%, 1%, 3% = 5%)
D-air brings out the wrecking ball, wildly swinging it down then forwards, the initial hitbox can spike foes and is great off-stage obviously, nice move (5%)
Grab is slow but has decent range, pummel (2%) is average speed, B-throw (5%) is her best throw as it can kill at high %s, but it's bugged and fails to do anything if the opponent was near a ledge when you grabbed them.. F-throw (5%) and U-throw (5%) are just for positioning since they can't kill or combo reasonably .. D-throw (4%) can spike off the ledge, but that's all really
If you press A+B as Nitori, you will enter a new mode, she will become slower and gain various changes and new moves:
U-tilt and U-air will now only deal one hit (5%)
F-tilt is bigger and stronger (3%x7? = 21%)
F-smash is totally new and sends out a gigantic bubble to trap foes in, getting faster the more you charge, grabbing through shields and allowing for free follow-ups, will not pop when hit by Nitori, until the opponent breaks out after a certain time or likely by mashing (0%)
N-Sp sends down a large rocket down that explodes at a set distance depending on if you held backward, neutral, or forward, good for pressure (12%)
F-Sp flies up then forward while carpeting the land below with 5 or less bombs, has high recovery in the air so it can't be spammed to recover easily (4% per bomb)
U-Sp calls in a large jet-powered machine to fly forward on sends you into freefall after, a worse recovery than the other U-Sp, but a bit better at defending yourself (2%x4 = 8%)
D-Sp lets you place a turret to fire in one of 8 directions you choose, it uses up your meter while firing, the meter slowly recharges over time, and you can press D-Sp again to deactivate the turret (5% per shot)
In summery: if you want somebody that has a freaking cool propeller strapped to their back, along with multi-hit moves and some other weird stuff, Nitori is for you
