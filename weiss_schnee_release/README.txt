Yang Xiao Long makes her way to Crusade joining fellow teammate Weiss Schnee!

Yang Xiao Long is a combo-heavy character who can rack up damage fast and capitalize with powerful kill moves. In addition,  the more damage she has taken, the stronger her attacks get.

Special Notes:
-Yang can cancel any of her non-Specials (except FAir, DAir, BAir, and Throws), into a Special.

Rage:
	- Starting at 50%, Yang gets 3% of her current damage taken as bonus damage to her attacks. This will stop counting at 150%.
	- Once she hits 100% and 150% during her first two stocks, afterimages and flames will appear at those respective percents. This means her Rage has been leveled up. Rage goes from Level 1 up to Level 4. Once Yang reaches 100% on her final stock, is on the ground in a neutral non-battle related state, and has at least Level 1 Rage, she will activate her Semblance fully, triggering one of the below buffs depending on the Level.
	Level 1: Rage multiplier is increased to 6%.
	Level 2: Rage multiplier is increased to 9%.
	Level 3: Her attacks gain extra properties.
	Level 4: Rage multiplier is increased to 12% and has no limit. She also gets access to 2 additional moves. Pressing Side A+B or Down A+B will let you use these moves on the ground only (note, these additional moves are not affected by Rage).
	
	

Neutral B: Firecracker/Bottle Rocket
- Yang fires a shot out of her gauntlets diagonally down. While at Level 3 or higher Rage, this move has less end lag for 1 shot, then is back to its regular end lag for 90 frames. Yang will pulse when this timer is over.

Side B: Burning Embers
- Yang dashes forward towards her opponent, if she hits, press Attack or Special for 1 of 2 follow ups.
	- Attack: Yang does an overhead kick that does good shield damage and meteors.
	- Special: Yang uppercuts her opponent then kicks them way.
	
Up B: Strawberry Sunrise
- Yang does a firey uppercut. While at Level 3 or higher Rage, this move has an additional hit.

Down B: Cold Shoulder
- Yang winds up and rushes forward attempting to grab her opponent. If she succeeds, she puts them over her shoulders and tosses them into the air.

NOTES:
Yang has 2 alternates. One turns off the music that automatically plays during her Semblance while the other gives her maxed out Rage and automatic semblance activation from the beginning of the match. The latter of which should not be used for balancing purposes.
