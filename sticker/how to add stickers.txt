I guess you wonder, how do I add the stickers? it is something easy to do
you will have to go to your cmc (only v7/7.2), and find the folder called sticker
there you will find four folders and three txt files,

In the common folder, you just have to put the sticker image and the description in desc (the four folders have the desc folder)

now, in the other three folders, you should open the txt of their respective name, you will find a number above, you should increas it

example
17
will become
18

and that's how easy it is!

Well now, you'll have to go all the way down from txt and write this in their respective txt
