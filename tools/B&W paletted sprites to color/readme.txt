Drop your character's black and white (paletted) sprites into this folder alongside a copy of the main palette file for the character; said palette file needs to be renamed "palette.png" (all lowercase, no PALETTE.png or Palette.png) for the program to read it. Run the program after this is done and if everything works correctly, the recoloured files should be generated in a little bit.
