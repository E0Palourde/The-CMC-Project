/*Servant Flier:
While active, any attack will spawn a bat circle on hit.
The circle then fires a set # of bat bullets that chases down the foe, leading to more pressure setups.
The circle's location, the bullet's properties, and more are determined by which move spawned the circle.

Example:
- Dsmash & Fsmash's bullets have more damage, bkb, & kbg.
- Usmash spawns the circle higher than normal, etc.
- Some moves have the circle move

The variables that edit the circle/bullet properties are found in step.
The bullet functions are found in char_custom3.
