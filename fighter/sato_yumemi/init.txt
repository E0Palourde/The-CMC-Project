//This is a comment. It has two / symbols preceding it to tell the game it must ignore these lines.
//If these were not used or you were to delete them, the game will crash upon trying to read this file.
//This is because computers don't understand our language. They understand specific commands and functions instead.

//Comments are used to document what everything in your code does for your own reference.
//They're also used to help others understand your code. For example, you reading this right now.

/* This is an extended comment. It has a / followed by a *, and it goes on until there's a * followed by a /.
By using this kind of comment, I don't have to bother putting a // before every line I write.
It's very useful.
It's also used to comment out whole chunks of code for pinpointing issues, or to simply make the game ignore a section of code.

Use this knowledge to your advantage in this init.txt file.
Delete these symbols if you want to make a section of code be read by the game.
(you'll need to do this in the voice files section you'll find by scrolling down a bunch).

Thanks for reading! :D

	//These two change the size of your character. 
	//Make sure to set these stats up first thing when setting your character's system stats up, since hitbox and projectile positions won't change alongside these two if you change them later. This may cause undesired results.
	
	//PLEASE DON'T HAVE THE XSIZE HAVE A DIFFERENT VALUE THAN THE YSIZE. XSIZE = YSIZE.
	//If for example, xsize = 0.1 and ysize = 0.1, this is a good setting.
	//If, instead, xsize = 1 but ysize = 0.5, this is horrible. This one will stretch the character horizontally and it will look hideous. You can play around with this to see what I mean. Always make sure xsize and ysize share the same value.
