Up Smash Summons a cloud, which stays around for a few seconds before it fires a thunderbolt. Color of cloud and power of thunderbolt depends on charge of smash. Can only have on cloud out at a time. 
Can have the cloud fire the thunderbolt early if up smash is activated while a cloud is out.

Neutral Special - Hocus Pocus
Ashley begins charging. The longer the charge, the more range this move has and the charge also changes the effect this move afflicts on the opponent. With no to little charge, the attack has small range and stuns the 
opponent very briefly. If the move is about halfway charged, it has greater range and afflicts a lip's stick effect on the opponent (increasing damage). Fully charged has the greatest range, and it makes the opponent fall 
asleep. The charge can be stored.

Side Special - Pantalones Giganticus
Ashley lifts her wand above her head, and after saying the spell, she fires a small projectile. If it hits the opponent, it’ll increase the opponent’s weight by 1/2 of their current weight for a brief time, allowing for 
greater combo potential as they are harder to knockback due to the weight gain. Occasionally, the move will backfire and make Ashley heavier (oh no, not again!), so be careful.

Up Special - Magic Broom
Ashley's wand turns into a broom. At the beginning of the attack she'll get a small boost upwards. She then gains the attributes of gliding and can glide around. She can build up momentum and damage opponents by ramming 
into them. Attack ends when the special button is pressed, Ashley lands on ground, or she gains too much height.

Down Special - Frightful Sight
Ashley turns away, and looks downwards. If she does not get hit, she'll return to her stance. If she gets hit, she'll quickly dawn a scary mask and her hair will turn pure white; the chilling sight stuns the opponents in 
place for a second or so, allowing for a counterattack. Also reflects projectiles.
