CHANGELOG:

Peach - Air speed nerfed drastically. Gravity and jump heights decreased. 
        Dair start up time reduced. Animation of Dair modified to look safer, and hitboxes altered corresponding to 
        these changes. 
        Nair reduced in size by ingame scaling and has a smoother animation.
        U Air has a redone animation
        F Smash now has further reach and a somewhat smoother animation.
        B Air has the Smash Ultimate recoil effect.
        Fair has a much smoother animation.
        Side Special can no longer glide ten miles across the stage.
        Peach is now slightly taller so that she wouldn't be a dwarf.
        D Smash now sends opponents flying in front of her instead of behind her.
        

Turnips - Weight increased. Turnip base throw speed greatly reduced. Air resistance added. Turnips are now slightly 
          larger and can be grabbed more easily. Turnips now bounce off the ground once before disappearing, but
          do not affect opponents in this state. Turnips no longer have competely broken priority and properly
          discard when conditions are met. Fixed strange glitch where colliding turnips would allow the player
          to recreate the infamous blackhole glitch. 

EXPERIMENTAL - Turnips can meteor smash when dropped or thrown down. Questionably fun if you ask me.
