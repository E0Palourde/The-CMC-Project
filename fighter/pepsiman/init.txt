//This is a comment. It has two / symbols preceding it to tell the game it must ignore these lines.
//If these were not used or you were to delete them, the game will crash upon trying to read this file.
//This is because computers don't understand our language. They understand specific commands and functions instead.

//Comments are used to document what everything in your code does for your own reference.
//They're also used to help others understand your code. For example, you reading this right now.

/* This is an extended comment. It has a / followed by a *, and it goes on until there's a * followed by a /.
By using this kind of comment, I don't have to bother putting a // before every line I write.
It's very useful.
It's also used to comment out whole chunks of code for pinpointing issues, or to simply make the game ignore a section of code.

Use this knowledge to your advantage in this init.txt file.
Delete these symbols if you want to make a section of code be read by the game.
(you'll need to do this in the voice files section you'll find by scrolling down a bunch).

Thanks for reading! :D
